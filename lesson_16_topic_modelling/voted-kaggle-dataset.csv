This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, ... V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-senstive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.
Given the class imbalance ratio, we recommend measuring the accuracy using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). Confusion matrix accuracy is not meaningful for unbalanced classification.
The dataset has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles) on big data mining and fraud detection. More details on current and past projects on related topics are available on http://mlg.ulb.ac.be/BruFence and http://mlg.ulb.ac.be/ARTML

What you get:
+25,000 matches
+10,000 players
11 European Countries with their lead championship
Seasons 2008 to 2016
Players and Teams' attributes* sourced from EA Sports' FIFA video game series, including the weekly updates

Betting odds from up to 10 providers
Detailed match events (goal types, possession, corner, cross, fouls, cards etc...) for +10,000 matches
*16th Oct 2016: New table containing teams' attributes from FIFA !
Original Data Source:
You can easily find data about soccer matches but they are usually scattered across different websites. A thorough data collection and processing has been done to make your life easier. I must insist that you do not make any commercial use of the data. The data was sourced from:
http://football-data.mx-api.enetscores.com/ : scores, lineup, team formation and events
http://www.football-data.co.uk/ : betting odds. Click here to understand the column naming system for betting odds:
http://sofifa.com/ : players and teams attributes from EA Sports FIFA games. FIFA series and all FIFA assets property of EA Sports.
When you have a look at the database, you will notice foreign keys for players and matches are the same as the original data sources. I have called those foreign keys ""api_id"".
Improving the dataset:
You will notice that some players are missing from the lineup (NULL values). This is because I have not been able to source their attributes from FIFA. This will be fixed overtime as the crawling algorithm is being improved. The dataset will also be expanded to include international games, national cups, Champion's League and Europa League. Please ask me if you're after a specific tournament.
Please get in touch with me if you want to help improve this dataset.
CLICK HERE TO ACCESS THE PROJECT GITHUB
Important note for people interested in using the crawlers: since I first wrote the crawling scripts (in python), it appears sofifa.com has changed its design and with it comes new requirements for the scripts. The existing script to crawl players ('Player Spider') will not work until i've updated it.
Exploring the data:
Now that's the fun part, there is a lot you can do with this dataset. I will be adding visuals and insights to this overview page but please have a look at the kernels and give it a try yourself ! Here are some ideas for you:
The Holy Grail... ... is obviously to predict the outcome of the game. The bookies use 3 classes (Home Win, Draw, Away Win). They get it right about 53% of the time. This is also what I've achieved so far using my own SVM. Though it may sound high for such a random sport game, you've got to know that the home team wins about 46% of the time. So the base case (constantly predicting Home Win) has indeed 46% precision.
Probabilities vs Odds
When running a multi-class classifier like SVM you could also output a probability estimate and compare it to the betting odds. Have a look at your variance vs odds and see for what games you had very different predictions.
Explore and visualize features
With access to players and teams attributes, team formations and in-game events you should be able to produce some interesting insights into The Beautiful Game . Who knows, Guardiola himself may hire one of you some day!"
TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset,"Metadata on ~5,000 movies from TMDb",The Movie Database (TMDb),1024,"Version 2,2017-09-28",film,CSV,44 MB,Other,"446,255 views","62,002 downloads","1,394 kernels",46 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata,"Background
What can we say about the success of a movie before it is released? Are there certain companies (Pixar?) that have found a consistent formula? Given that major films costing over $100 million to produce can still flop, this question is more important than ever to the industry. Film aficionados might have different interests. Can we predict which films will be highly rated, whether or not they are a commercial success?
This is a great place to start digging in to those questions, with data on the plot, cast, crew, budget, and revenues of several thousand films.
Data Source Transfer Summary
We (Kaggle) have removed the original version of this dataset per a DMCA takedown request from IMDB. In order to minimize the impact, we're replacing it with a similar set of films and data fields from The Movie Database (TMDb) in accordance with their terms of use. The bad news is that kernels built on the old dataset will most likely no longer work.
The good news is that:
You can port your existing kernels over with a bit of editing. This kernel offers functions and examples for doing so. You can also find a general introduction to the new format here.
The new dataset contains full credits for both the cast and the crew, rather than just the first three actors.
Actor and actresses are now listed in the order they appear in the credits. It's unclear what ordering the original dataset used; for the movies I spot checked it didn't line up with either the credits order or IMDB's stars order.
The revenues appear to be more current. For example, IMDB's figures for Avatar seem to be from 2010 and understate the film's global revenues by over $2 billion.
Some of the movies that we weren't able to port over (a couple of hundred) were just bad entries. For example, this IMDB entry has basically no accurate information at all. It lists Star Wars Episode VII as a documentary.
Data Source Transfer Details
Several of the new columns contain json. You can save a bit of time by porting the load data functions from this kernel.
Even in simple fields like runtime may not be consistent across versions. For example, previous dataset shows the duration for Avatar's extended cut while TMDB shows the time for the original version.
There's now a separate file containing the full credits for both the cast and crew.
All fields are filled out by users so don't expect them to agree on keywords, genres, ratings, or the like.
Your existing kernels will continue to render normally until they are re-run.
If you are curious about how this dataset was prepared, the code to access TMDb's API is posted here.
New columns:

Open Questions About the Data
There are some things we haven't had a chance to confirm about the new dataset. If you have any insights, please let us know in the forums!
Are the budgets and revenues all in US dollars? Do they consistently show the global revenues?
This dataset hasn't yet gone through a data quality analysis. Can you find any obvious corrections? For example, in the IMDb version it was necessary to treat values of zero in the budget field as missing. Similar findings would be very helpful to your fellow Kagglers! (It's probably a good idea to keep treating zeros as missing, with the caveat that missing budgets much more likely to have been from small budget films in the first place).
Inspiration
Can you categorize the films by type, such as animated or not? We don't have explicit labels for this, but it should be possible to build them from the crew's job titles.
How sharp is the divide between major film studios and the independents? Do those two groups fall naturally out of a clustering analysis or is something more complicated going on?

Bitcoin is the longest running and most well known cryptocurrency, first released as open source in 2009 by the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin serves as a decentralized medium of digital exchange, with transactions verified and recorded in a public distributed ledger (the blockchain) without the need for a trusted record keeping authority or central intermediary. Transaction blocks contain a SHA-256 cryptographic hash of previous transaction blocks, and are thus ""chained"" together, serving as an immutable record of all transactions that have ever occurred. As with any currency/commodity on the market, bitcoin trading and financial instruments soon followed public adoption of bitcoin and continue to grow. Included here is historical bitcoin market data at 1-min intervals for select bitcoin exchanges where trading takes place. Happy (data) mining!

For the first time, Kaggle conducted an industry-wide survey to establish a comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. The survey received over 16,000 responses and we learned a ton about who is working with data, what‚Äôs happening at the cutting edge of machine learning across industries, and how new data scientists can best break into the field.
To share some of the initial insights from the survey, we‚Äôve worked with the folks from The Pudding to put together this interactive report. They‚Äôve shared all of the kernels used in the report here.
Content
The data includes 5 files:
schema.csv: a CSV file with survey schema. This schema includes the questions that correspond to each column name in both the multipleChoiceResponses.csv and freeformResponses.csv.
multipleChoiceResponses.csv: Respondents' answers to multiple choice and ranking questions. These are non-randomized and thus a single row does correspond to all of a single user's answers. -freeformResponses.csv: Respondents' freeform answers to Kaggle's survey questions. These responses are randomized within a column, so that reading across a single row does not give a single user's answers.
conversionRates.csv: Currency conversion rates (to USD) as accessed from the R package ""quantmod"" on September 14, 2017
RespondentTypeREADME.txt: This is a schema for decoding the responses in the ""Asked"" column of the schema.csv file.
Kernel Awards in November
In the month of November, we‚Äôre awarding $1000 a week for code and analyses shared on this dataset via Kaggle Kernels. Read more about this month‚Äôs Kaggle Kernels Awards and help us advance the state of machine learning and data science by exploring this one of a kind dataset.
Methodology
This survey received 16,716 usable respondents from 171 countries and territories. If a country or territory received less than 50 respondents, we grouped them into a group named ‚ÄúOther‚Äù for anonymity.
We excluded respondents who were flagged by our survey system as ‚ÄúSpam‚Äù or who did not answer the question regarding their employment status (this question was the first required question, so not answering it indicates that the respondent did not proceed past the 5th question in our survey).
Most of our respondents were found primarily through Kaggle channels, like our email list, discussion forums and social media channels.
The survey was live from August 7th to August 25th. The median response time for those who participated in the survey was 16.4 minutes. We allowed respondents to complete the survey at any time during that window.
We received salary data by first asking respondents for their day-to-day currency, and then asking them to write in either their total compensation.
We‚Äôve provided a csv with an exchange rate to USD for you to calculate the salary in US dollars on your own.
The question was optional
Not every question was shown to every respondent. In an attempt to ask relevant questions to each respondent, we generally asked work related questions to employed data scientists and learning related questions to students. There is a column in the schema.csv file called ""Asked"" that describes who saw each question. You can learn more about the different segments we used in the schema.csv file and RespondentTypeREADME.txt in the data tab.
To protect the respondents‚Äô identity, the answers to multiple choice questions have been separated into a separate data file from the open-ended responses. We do not provide a key to match up the multiple choice and free form responses. Further, the free form responses have been randomized column-wise such that the responses that appear on the same row did not necessarily come from the same survey-taker."

Description:
There are two channels of data provided in this dataset:
News data: I crawled historical news headlines from Reddit WorldNews Channel (/r/worldnews). They are ranked by reddit users' votes, and only the top 25 headlines are considered for a single date. (Range: 2008-06-08 to 2016-07-01)
Stock data: Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is used to ""prove the concept"". (Range: 2008-08-08 to 2016-07-01)
I provided three data files in .csv format:
RedditNews.csv: two columns The first column is the ""date"", and second column is the ""news headlines"". All news are ranked from top to bottom based on how hot they are. Hence, there are 25 lines for each date.
DJIA_table.csv: Downloaded directly from Yahoo Finance: check out the web page for more info.
Combined_News_DJIA.csv: To make things easier for my students, I provide this combined dataset with 27 columns. The first column is ""Date"", the second is ""Label"", and the following ones are news headlines ranging from ""Top1"" to ""Top25"".
=========================================
To my students:
I made this a binary classification task. Hence, there are only two labels:
""1"" when DJIA Adj Close value rose or stayed as the same;
""0"" when DJIA Adj Close value decreased.
For task evaluation, please use data from 2008-08-08 to 2014-12-31 as Training Set, and Test Set is then the following two years data (from 2015-01-02 to 2016-07-01). This is roughly a 80%/20% split.
And, of course, use AUC as the evaluation metric.

It has been of great use when teaching statistics to kids. With certain types you can also give a geeky introduction to machine learning.
This are the raw attributes that are used for calculating how much damage an attack will do in the games. This dataset is about the pokemon games (NOT pokemon cards or Pokemon Go).
The data as described by Myles O'Neill is:
#: ID for each pokemon
Name: Name of each pokemon
Type 1: Each pokemon has a type, this determines weakness/resistance to attacks
Type 2: Some pokemon are dual type and have 2
Total: sum of all stats that come after this, a general guide to how strong a pokemon is
HP: hit points, or health, defines how much damage a pokemon can withstand before fainting
Attack: the base modifier for normal attacks (eg. Scratch, Punch)
Defense: the base damage resistance against normal attacks
SP Atk: special attack, the base modifier for special attacks (e.g. fire blast, bubble beam)
SP Def: the base damage resistance against special attacks
Speed: determines which pokemon attacks first each round
The data for this table has been acquired from several different sites, including:
pokemon.com
pokemondb
bulbapeida
One question has been answered with this database: The type of a pokemon cannot be inferred only by it's Attack and Deffence. It would be worthy to find which two variables can define the type of a pokemon, if any. Two variables can be plotted in a 2D space, and used as an example for machine learning. This could mean the creation of a visual example any geeky Machine Learning class would love."

After watching Somm (a documentary on master sommeliers) I wondered how I could create a predictive model to identify wines through blind tasting like a master sommelier would. The first step in this journey was gathering some data to train a model. I plan to use deep learning to predict the wine variety using words in the description/review. The model still won't be able to taste the wine, but theoretically it could identify the wine based on a description that a sommelier could give. If anyone has any ideas on how to accomplish this, please post them!
Content
The data consists of 10 fields:
Points: the number of points WineEnthusiast rated the wine on a scale of 1-100 (though they say they only post reviews for wines that score >=80)
Title: the title of the wine review, which often contains the vintage if you're interested in extracting that feature
Variety: the type of grapes used to make the wine (ie Pinot Noir)
Description: a few sentences from a sommelier describing the wine's taste, smell, look, feel, etc.
Country: the country that the wine is from
Province: the province or state that the wine is from
Region 1: the wine growing area in a province or state (ie Napa)
Region 2: sometimes there are more specific regions specified within a wine growing area (ie Rutherford inside the Napa Valley), but this value can sometimes be blank
Winery: the winery that made the wine
Designation: the vineyard within the winery where the grapes that made the wine are from
Price: the cost for a bottle of the wine
Taster Name: name of the person who tasted and reviewed the wine
Taster Twitter Handle: Twitter handle for the person who tasted and reviewed the wine
Acknowledgements
The data was scraped from WineEnthusiast during the week of June 15th, 2017. The code for the scraper can be found here if you have any more specific questions about data collection that I didn't address.
UPDATE 11/24/2017 After feedback from users of the dataset I scraped the reviews again on November 22nd, 2017. This time around I collected the title of each review, which you can parse the year out of, the tasters name, and the taster's Twitter handle. This should also fix the duplicate entry issue.
Inspiration
I think that this dataset offers some great opportunities for sentiment analysis and other text related predictive models. My overall goal is to create a model that can identify the variety, winery, and location of a wine based on a description. If anyone has any ideas, breakthroughs, or other interesting insights/models please post them."

We are turning some of the data over to you so you can form your own view.
Even more than with other data sets that Kaggle has featured, there‚Äôs a huge amount of data cleaning and preparation that goes into putting together a long-time study of climate trends. Early data was collected by technicians using mercury thermometers, where any variation in the visit time impacted measurements. In the 1940s, the construction of airports caused many weather stations to be moved. In the 1980s, there was a move to electronic thermometers that are said to have a cooling bias.
Given this complexity, there are a range of organizations that collate climate trends data. The three most cited land and ocean temperature data sets are NOAA‚Äôs MLOST, NASA‚Äôs GISTEMP and the UK‚Äôs HadCrut.
We have repackaged the data from a newer compilation put together by the Berkeley Earth, which is affiliated with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Study combines 1.6 billion temperature reports from 16 pre-existing archives. It is nicely packaged and allows for slicing into interesting subsets (for example by country). They publish the source data and the code for the transformations they applied. They also use methods that allow weather observations from shorter time series to be included, meaning fewer observations need to be thrown away.
In this dataset, we have include several files:
Global Land and Ocean-and-Land Temperatures (GlobalTemperatures.csv):
Date: starts in 1750 for average land temperature and 1850 for max and min land temperatures and global ocean and land temperatures
LandAverageTemperature: global average land temperature in celsius
LandAverageTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the average
LandMaxTemperature: global average maximum land temperature in celsius
LandMaxTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the maximum land temperature
LandMinTemperature: global average minimum land temperature in celsius
LandMinTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the minimum land temperature
LandAndOceanAverageTemperature: global average land and ocean temperature in celsius
LandAndOceanAverageTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the global average land and ocean temperature
Other files include:

Party school? Liberal Arts college? State School? You already know your starting salary will be different depending on what type of school you attend. But, increased earning power shows less disparity. Ten years out, graduates of Ivy League schools earned 99% more than they did at graduation. Party school graduates saw an 85% increase. Engineering school graduates fared worst, earning 76% more 10 years out of school. See where your school ranks.
Salaries By Region
Attending college in the Midwest leads to the lowest salary both at graduation and at mid-career, according to the PayScale Inc. survey. Graduates of schools in the Northeast and California fared best.
Salary Increase By Major
Your parents might have worried when you chose Philosophy or International Relations as a major. But a year-long survey of 1.2 million people with only a bachelor's degree by PayScale Inc. shows that graduates in these subjects earned 103.5% and 97.8% more, respectively, about 10 years post-commencement.

Learn which features spell certain death and which are most palatable in this dataset of mushroom characteristics. And how certain can your model be?
Content
This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like ""leaflets three, let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.

The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The first report was published in 2012, the second in 2013, the third in 2015, and the fourth in the 2016 Update. The World Happiness 2017, which ranks 155 countries by their happiness levels, was released at the United Nations at an event celebrating International Day of Happiness on March 20th. The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. Leading experts across fields ‚Äì economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public policy and more ‚Äì describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.
Content
The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. This question, known as the Cantril ladder, asks respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0 and to rate their own current lives on that scale. The scores are from nationally representative samples for the years 2013-2016 and use the Gallup weights to make the estimates representative. The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors ‚Äì economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity ‚Äì contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world‚Äôs lowest national averages for each of the six factors. They have no impact on the total score reported for each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher than others.
Inspiration
What countries or regions rank the highest in overall happiness and each of the six factors contributing to happiness? How did country ranks or scores change between the 2015 and 2016 as well as the 2016 and 2017 reports? Did any country experience a significant increase or decrease in happiness?
What is Dystopia?
Dystopia is an imaginary country that has the world‚Äôs least-happy people. The purpose in establishing Dystopia is to have a benchmark against which all countries can be favorably compared (no country performs more poorly than Dystopia) in terms of each of the six key variables, thus allowing each sub-bar to be of positive width. The lowest scores observed for the six key variables, therefore, characterize Dystopia. Since life would be very unpleasant in a country with the world‚Äôs lowest incomes, lowest life expectancy, lowest generosity, most corruption, least freedom and least social support, it is referred to as ‚ÄúDystopia,‚Äù in contrast to Utopia.
What are the residuals?
The residuals, or unexplained components, differ for each country, reflecting the extent to which the six variables either over- or under-explain average 2014-2016 life evaluations. These residuals have an average value of approximately zero over the whole set of countries. Figure 2.2 shows the average residual for each country when the equation in Table 2.1 is applied to average 2014- 2016 data for the six variables in that country. We combine these residuals with the estimate for life evaluations in Dystopia so that the combined bar will always have positive values. As can be seen in Figure 2.2, although some life evaluation residuals are quite large, occasionally exceeding one point on the scale from 0 to 10, they are always much smaller than the calculated value in Dystopia, where the average life is rated at 1.85 on the 0 to 10 scale.
What do the columns succeeding the Happiness Score(like Family, Generosity, etc.) describe?
The following columns: GDP per Capita, Family, Life Expectancy, Freedom, Generosity, Trust Government Corruption describe the extent to which these factors contribute in evaluating the happiness in each country. The Dystopia Residual metric actually is the Dystopia Happiness Score(1.85) + the Residual value or the unexplained value for each country as stated in the previous answer.
If you add all these factors up, you get the happiness score so it might be un-reliable to model them to predict Happiness Scores.

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images‚Äîconsisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Zalando intends Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.
The original MNIST dataset contains a lot of handwritten digits. Members of the AI/ML/Data Science community love this dataset and use it as a benchmark to validate their algorithms. In fact, MNIST is often the first dataset researchers try. ""If it doesn't work on MNIST, it won't work at all"", they said. ""Well, if it does work on MNIST, it may still fail on others.""
Zalando seeks to replace the original MNIST dataset
Content
Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255. The training and test data sets have 785 columns. The first column consists of the class labels (see above), and represents the article of clothing. The rest of the columns contain the pixel-values of the associated image.
To locate a pixel on the image, suppose that we have decomposed x as x = i * 28 + j, where i and j are integers between 0 and 27. The pixel is located on row i and column j of a 28 x 28 matrix.
For example, pixel31 indicates the pixel that is in the fourth column from the left, and the second row from the top, as in the ascii-diagram below.

Labels
Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:
0 T-shirt/top
1 Trouser
2 Pullover
3 Dress
4 Coat
5 Sandal
6 Shirt
7 Sneaker
8 Bag
9 Ankle boot

TL;DR
Each row is a separate image
Column 1 is the class label.
Remaining columns are pixel numbers (784 total).
Each value is the darkness of the pixel (1 to 255)

This dataset combines three sources of data, all of which are based on information from the book series.
Firstly, there is battles.csv which contains Chris Albon's ""The War of the Five Kings"" Dataset, which can be found here: https://github.com/chrisalbon/war_of_the_five_kings_dataset . Its a great collection of all of the battles in the series.
Secondly we have character-deaths.csv from Erin Pierce and Ben Kahle. This dataset was created as a part of their Bayesian Survival Analysis which can be found here: http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2015/03/bayesian-survival-analysis-for-game-of.html
Finally we have a more comprehensive character dataset with character-predictions.csv. This comes from the team at A Song of Ice and Data who scraped it from http://awoiaf.westeros.org/ . It also includes their predictions on which character will die, the methodology of which can be found here: https://got.show/machine-learning-algorithm-predicts-death-game-of-thrones
What insights about the complicated political landscape of this fantasy world can you find in this data?
Of course, it goes without saying that this dataset contains spoilers ;)"

(Or, at least, love in the first four minutes?) This dataset was compiled by Columbia Business School professors Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar for their paper Gender Differences in Mate Selection: Evidence From a Speed Dating Experiment.
Data was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four minute ""first date"" with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.
The dataset also includes questionnaire data gathered from participants at different points in the process. These fields include: demographics, dating habits, self-perception across key attributes, beliefs on what others find valuable in a mate, and lifestyle information. See the Speed Dating Data Key document below for details.
For more analysis from Iyengar and Fisman, read Racial Preferences in Dating.
Data Exploration Ideas
What are the least desirable attributes in a male partner? Does this differ for female partners?
How important do people think attractiveness is in potential mate selection vs. its real impact?
Are shared interests more important than a shared racial background?
Can people accurately predict their own perceived value in the dating market?
In terms of getting a second date, is it better to be someone's first speed date of the night or their last?"
Football Events,"More than 900,000 events from 9,074 football games across Europe",Alin Secareanu,256,"Version 1,2017-01-25",association football,CSV,174 MB,Other,"49,559 views","9,488 downloads",89 kernels,5 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/secareanualin/football-events,"Context
Most publicly available football (soccer) statistics are limited to aggregated data such as Goals, Shots, Fouls, Cards. When assessing performance or building predictive models, this simple aggregation, without any context, can be misleading. For example, a team that produced 10 shots on target from long range has a lower chance of scoring than a club that produced the same amount of shots from inside the box. However, metrics derived from this simple count of shots will similarly asses the two teams.
A football game generates much more events and it is very important and interesting to take into account the context in which those events were generated. This dataset should keep sports analytics enthusiasts awake for long hours as the number of questions that can be asked is huge.
Content
This dataset is a result of a very tiresome effort of webscraping and integrating different data sources. The central element is the text commentary. All the events were derived by reverse engineering the text commentary, using regex. Using this, I was able to derive 11 types of events, as well as the main player and secondary player involved in those events and many other statistics. In case I've missed extracting some useful information, you are gladly invited to do so and share your findings. The dataset provides a granular view of 9,074 games, totaling 941,009 events from the biggest 5 European football (soccer) leagues: England, Spain, Germany, Italy, France from 2011/2012 season to 2016/2017 season as of 25.01.2017. There are games that have been played during these seasons for which I could not collect detailed data. Overall, over 90% of the played games during these seasons have event data.
The dataset is organized in 3 files:
events.csv contains event data about each game. Text commentary was scraped from: bbc.com, espn.com and onefootball.com
ginf.csv - contains metadata and market odds about each game. odds were collected from oddsportal.com
dictionary.txt contains a dictionary with the textual description of each categorical variable coded with integers
Past Research
I have used this data to:
create predictive models for football games in order to bet on football outcomes.
make visualizations about upcoming games
build expected goals models and compare players
Inspiration
There are tons of interesting questions a sports enthusiast can answer with this dataset. For example:
What is the value of a shot? Or what is the probability of a shot being a goal given it's location, shooter, league, assist method, gamestate, number of players on the pitch, time - known as expected goals (xG) models
When are teams more likely to score?
Which teams are the best or sloppiest at holding the lead?
Which teams or players make the best use of set pieces?
In which leagues is the referee more likely to give a card?
How do players compare when they shoot with their week foot versus strong foot? Or which players are ambidextrous?
Identify different styles of plays (shooting from long range vs shooting from the box, crossing the ball vs passing the ball, use of headers)
Which teams have a bias for attacking on a particular flank?
And many many more..."

Zillow's Economic Research Team collects, cleans and publishes housing and economic data from a variety of public and proprietary sources. Public property record data filed with local municipalities -- including deeds, property facts, parcel information and transactional histories -- forms the backbone of our data products, and is fleshed out with proprietary data derived from property listings and user behavior on Zillow.
The large majority of Zillow's aggregated housing market and economic data is made available for free download at zillow.com/data.
Content
Variable Availability:
Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI): A smoothed seasonally adjusted measure of the median estimated home value across a given region and housing type. A dollar denominated alternative to repeat-sales indices. Find a more detailed methodology here: http://www.zillow.com/research/zhvi-methodology-6032/
Zillow Rent Index (ZRI): A smoothed seasonally adjusted measure of the median estimated market rate rent across a given region and housing type. A dollar denominated alternative to repeat-rent indices. Find a more detailed methodology here: http://www.zillow.com/research/zillow-rent-index-methodology-2393/
For-Sale Listing/Inventory Metrics: Zillow provides many variables capturing current and historical for-sale listings availability, generally from 2012 to current. These variables include median list prices and inventory counts, both by various property types. Variables capturing for-sale market competitiveness including share of listings with a price cut, median price cut size, age of inventory, and the days a listing spend on Zillow before the sale is final.
Home Sales Metrics: Zillow provides data on sold homes including median sale price by various housing types, sale counts (methodology here: http://www.zillow.com/research/home-sales-methodology-7733/), and a normalized view of sale volume referred to as turnover. The prevalence of foreclosures is also provided as ratio of the housing stock and the share of all sales in which the home was previously foreclosed upon.
For-Rent Listing Metrics: Zillow provides median rents prices and median rent price per square foot by property type and bedroom count.
Housing type definitions:
All Homes: Zillow defines all homes as single-family, condominium and co-operative homes with a county record. Unless specified, all series cover this segment of the housing stock.
Condo/Co-op: Condominium and co-operative homes.
Multifamily 5+ units: Units in buildings with 5 or more housing units, that are not a condominiums or co-ops.
Duplex/Triplex: Housing units in buildings with 2 or 3 housing units.
Tiers: By metro, we determine price tier cutoffs that divide the all homes housing stock into thirds using the full distribution of estimated home values. We then estimate real estate metrics within the property sets, Bottom, Middle, and Top, defined by these cutoffs. When reported at the national level, all Bottom Tier homes defined at the metro level are pooled together to form the national bottom tier. The same holds for Middle and Top Tier homes.
Regional Availability:
Zillow metrics are reported for common US geographies including Nation, State, Metro (2013 Census Defined CBSAs), County, City, ZIP code, and Neighborhood.
We provide a crosswalk between colloquial Zillow region names and federally defined region names and linking variables such as County FIPS codes and CBSA codes. Cities and Neighborhoods do not match standard jurisdictional boundaries. Zillow city boundaries reflect mailing address conventions and so are often visually similar to collections of ZIP codes. Zillow neighborhood boundaries can be found here.
Suppression Rules: To ensure reliability of reported values the Zillow Economic Research team applies suppression rules triggered by low sample sizes and excessive volatility. These rules are customized to the metric and region type and explain most missingness found in the provided datasets.

In the last few days, I have been hearing a lot of buzz around cryptocurrencies. Things like Block chain, Bitcoin, Bitcoin cash, Ethereum, Ripple etc are constantly coming in the news articles I read. So I wanted to understand more about it and this post helped me get started. Once the basics are done, the DS guy sleeping inside me (always lazy.!) woke up and started raising questions like
How many such cryptocurrencies are there and what are their prices and valuations?
Why is there a sudden surge in the interest in recent days? Is it due to the increase in the price in the last few days? etc.
For getting answers to all these questions (and if possible to predict the future prices ;)), I started getting the data from coinmarketcap about the cryptocurrencies.
Update : Bitcoin dataset
So what next.? Now that we have the price data, I wanted to dig a little more about the factors affecting the price of coins. I started of with Bitcoin and there are quite a few parameters which affect the price of Bitcoin. Thanks to Blockchain Info, I was able to get quite a few parameters on once in two day basis.
This will help understand the other factors related to Bitcoin price and also help one make future predictions in a better way than just using the historical price.
Update2: Ethereum Dataset:
This dataset has features related to Ethereum. This is very similar to the bitcoin dataset and is available on a daily basis. Data is taken from Etherscan and the credits go to them for allowing us to use.

The Myers Briggs Type Indicator (or MBTI for short) is a personality type system that divides everyone into 16 distinct personality types across 4 axis:
Introversion (I) ‚Äì Extroversion (E)
Intuition (N) ‚Äì Sensing (S)
Thinking (T) ‚Äì Feeling (F)
Judging (J) ‚Äì Perceiving (P)
(More can be learned about what these mean here)
So for example, someone who prefers introversion, intuition, thinking and perceiving would be labelled an INTP in the MBTI system, and there are lots of personality based components that would model or describe this person‚Äôs preferences or behaviour based on the label.
It is one of, if not the, the most popular personality test in the world. It is used in businesses, online, for fun, for research and lots more. A simple google search reveals all of the different ways the test has been used over time. It‚Äôs safe to say that this test is still very relevant in the world in terms of its use.
From scientific or psychological perspective it is based on the work done on cognitive functions by Carl Jung i.e. Jungian Typology. This was a model of 8 distinct functions, thought processes or ways of thinking that were suggested to be present in the mind. Later this work was transformed into several different personality systems to make it more accessible, the most popular of which is of course the MBTI.
Recently, its use/validity has come into question because of unreliability in experiments surrounding it, among other reasons. But it is still clung to as being a very useful tool in a lot of areas, and the purpose of this dataset is to help see if any patterns can be detected in specific types and their style of writing, which overall explores the validity of the test in analysing, predicting or categorising behaviour.

Ranking universities is a difficult, political, and controversial practice. There are hundreds of different national and international university ranking systems, many of which disagree with each other. This dataset contains three global university rankings from very different places.
University Ranking Data
The Times Higher Education World University Ranking is widely regarded as one of the most influential and widely observed university measures. Founded in the United Kingdom in 2010, it has been criticized for its commercialization and for undermining non-English-instructing institutions.
The Academic Ranking of World Universities, also known as the Shanghai Ranking, is an equally influential ranking. It was founded in China in 2003 and has been criticized for focusing on raw research power and for undermining humanities and quality of instruction.
The Center for World University Rankings, is a less well know listing that comes from Saudi Arabia, it was founded in 2012.
How do these rankings compare to each other?
Are the various criticisms levied against these rankings fair or not?
How does your alma mater fare against the world?
Supplementary Data
To further extend your analyses, we've also included two sets of supplementary data.
The first of these is a set of data on educational attainment around the world. It comes from The World Data Bank and comprises information from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics and the Barro-Lee Dataset. How does national educational attainment relate to the quality of each nation's universities?
The second supplementary dataset contains information about public and private direct expenditure on education across nations. This data comes from the National Center for Education Statistics. It represents expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product. Does spending more on education lead to better international university rankings?"

Gender Recognition by Voice and Speech Analysis
This database was created to identify a voice as male or female, based upon acoustic properties of the voice and speech. The dataset consists of 3,168 recorded voice samples, collected from male and female speakers. The voice samples are pre-processed by acoustic analysis in R using the seewave and tuneR packages, with an analyzed frequency range of 0hz-280hz (human vocal range).
The Dataset
The following acoustic properties of each voice are measured and included within the CSV:
meanfreq: mean frequency (in kHz)
sd: standard deviation of frequency
median: median frequency (in kHz)
Q25: first quantile (in kHz)
Q75: third quantile (in kHz)
IQR: interquantile range (in kHz)
skew: skewness (see note in specprop description)
kurt: kurtosis (see note in specprop description)
sp.ent: spectral entropy
sfm: spectral flatness
mode: mode frequency
centroid: frequency centroid (see specprop)
peakf: peak frequency (frequency with highest energy)
meanfun: average of fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal
minfun: minimum fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal
maxfun: maximum fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal
meandom: average of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal
mindom: minimum of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal
maxdom: maximum of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal
dfrange: range of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal
modindx: modulation index. Calculated as the accumulated absolute difference between adjacent measurements of fundamental frequencies divided by the frequency range

Research Questions
An original analysis of the data-set can be found in the following article:
Identifying the Gender of a Voice using Machine Learning
The best model achieves 99% accuracy on the test set. According to a CART model, it appears that looking at the mean fundamental frequency might be enough to accurately classify a voice. However, some male voices use a higher frequency, even though their resonance differs from female voices, and may be incorrectly classified as female. To the human ear, there is apparently more than simple frequency, that determines a voice's gender.
Questions
What other features differ between male and female voices?
Can we find a difference in resonance between male and female voices?
Can we identify falsetto from regular voices? (separate data-set likely needed for this)
Are there other interesting features in the data?
CART Diagram
Mean fundamental frequency appears to be an indicator of voice gender, with a threshold of 140hz separating male from female classifications.

H-1B visas are a category of employment-based, non-immigrant visas for temporary foreign workers in the United States. For a foreign national to apply for H1-B visa, a US employer must offer them a job and submit a petition for a H-1B visa to the US immigration department. This is also the most common visa status applied for and held by international students once they complete college or higher education and begin working in a full-time position.
The following articles contain more information about the H-1B visa process:

This dataset contains five year's worth of H-1B petition data, with approximately 3 million records overall. The columns in the dataset include case status, employer name, worksite coordinates, job title, prevailing wage, occupation code, and year filed.
For more information on individual columns, refer to the column metadata. A detailed description of the underlying raw dataset is available in an official data dictionary.

In 2013, students of the Statistics class at FSEV UK were asked to invite their friends to participate in this survey.
The data file (responses.csv) consists of 1010 rows and 150 columns (139 integer and 11 categorical).
For convenience, the original variable names were shortened in the data file. See the columns.csv file if you want to match the data with the original names.
The data contain missing values.
The survey was presented to participants in both electronic and written form.
The original questionnaire was in Slovak language and was later translated into English.
All participants were of Slovakian nationality, aged between 15-30.
The variables can be split into the following groups:
Music preferences (19 items)
Movie preferences (12 items)
Hobbies & interests (32 items)
Phobias (10 items)
Health habits (3 items)
Personality traits, views on life, & opinions (57 items)
Spending habits (7 items)
Demographics (10 items)
Research questions
Many different techniques can be used to answer many questions, e.g.
Clustering: Given the music preferences, do people make up any clusters of similar behavior?
Hypothesis testing: Do women fear certain phenomena significantly more than men? Do the left handed people have different interests than right handed?
Predictive modeling: Can we predict spending habits of a person from his/her interests and movie or music preferences?
Dimension reduction: Can we describe a large number of human interests by a smaller number of latent concepts?
Correlation analysis: Are there any connections between music and movie preferences?
Visualization: How to effectively visualize a lot of variables in order to gain some meaningful insights from the data?
(Multivariate) Outlier detection: Small number of participants often cheats and randomly answers the questions. Can you identify them? Hint: Local outlier factor may help.
Missing values analysis: Are there any patterns in missing responses? What is the optimal way of imputing the values in surveys?
Recommendations: If some of user's interests are known, can we predict the other? Or, if we know what a person listen, can we predict which kind of movies he/she might like?

YouTube (the world-famous video sharing website) maintains a list of the top trending videos on the platform. According to Variety magazine, ‚ÄúTo determine the year‚Äôs top-trending videos, YouTube uses a combination of factors including measuring users interactions (number of views, shares, comments and likes). Note that they‚Äôre not the most-viewed videos overall for the calendar year‚Äù. Top performers on the YouTube trending list are music videos (such as the famously virile ‚ÄúGangam Style‚Äù), celebrity and/or reality TV performances, and the random dude-with-a-camera viral videos that YouTube is well-known for.
This dataset is a daily record of the top trending YouTube videos.
Note that this dataset is a structurally improved version of this dataset.
Content
This dataset includes several months (and counting) of data on daily trending YouTube videos. Data is included for the US, GB, DE, CA, and FR regions (USA, Great Britain, Germany, Canada, and France, respectively), with up to 200 listed trending videos per day.
Each region‚Äôs data is in a separate file. Data includes the video title, channel title, publish time, tags, views, likes and dislikes, description, and comment count.
The data also includes a category_id field, which varies between regions. To retrieve the categories for a specific video, find it in the associated JSON. One such file is included for each of the five regions in the dataset.
For more information on specific columns in the dataset refer to the column metadata.

Some political experts and opponents maintain that Clinton's use of personal email accounts to conduct Secretary of State affairs is in violation of protocols and federal laws that ensure appropriate recordkeeping of government activity. Hillary's campaign has provided their own four sentence summary of her email use here.
There have been a number of Freedom of Information lawsuits filed over the State Department's failure to fully release the emails sent and received on Clinton's private accounts. On Monday, August 31, the State Department released nearly 7,000 pages of Clinton's heavily redacted emails (its biggest release of emails to date).
The documents were released by the State Department as PDFs. We've cleaned and normalized the released documents and are hosting them for public analysis. Kaggle's choice to host this dataset is not meant to express any particular political affiliation or intent.

Chocolate is one of the most popular candies in the world. Each year, residents of the United States collectively eat more than 2.8 billions pounds. However, not all chocolate bars are created equal! This dataset contains expert ratings of over 1,700 individual chocolate bars, along with information on their regional origin, percentage of cocoa, the variety of chocolate bean used and where the beans were grown.
Flavors of Cacao Rating System:
5= Elite (Transcending beyond the ordinary limits)
4= Premium (Superior flavor development, character and style)
3= Satisfactory(3.0) to praiseworthy(3.75) (well made with special qualities)
2= Disappointing (Passable but contains at least one significant flaw)
1= Unpleasant (mostly unpalatable)
Each chocolate is evaluated from a combination of both objective qualities and subjective interpretation. A rating here only represents an experience with one bar from one batch. Batch numbers, vintages and review dates are included in the database when known.
The database is narrowly focused on plain dark chocolate with an aim of appreciating the flavors of the cacao when made into chocolate. The ratings do not reflect health benefits, social missions, or organic status.
Flavor is the most important component of the Flavors of Cacao ratings. Diversity, balance, intensity and purity of flavors are all considered. It is possible for a straight forward single note chocolate to rate as high as a complex flavor profile that changes throughout. Genetics, terroir, post harvest techniques, processing and storage can all be discussed when considering the flavor component.
Texture has a great impact on the overall experience and it is also possible for texture related issues to impact flavor. It is a good way to evaluate the makers vision, attention to detail and level of proficiency.
Aftermelt is the experience after the chocolate has melted. Higher quality chocolate will linger and be long lasting and enjoyable. Since the aftermelt is the last impression you get from the chocolate, it receives equal importance in the overall rating.
Overall Opinion is really where the ratings reflect a subjective opinion. Ideally it is my evaluation of whether or not the components above worked together and an opinion on the flavor development, character and style. It is also here where each chocolate can usually be summarized by the most prominent impressions that you would remember about each chocolate.

These ratings were compiled by Brady Brelinski, Founding Member of the Manhattan Chocolate Society. For up-to-date information, as well as additional content (including interviews with craft chocolate makers), please see his website: Flavors of Cacao

This directory contains data on over 4.5 million Uber pickups in New York City from April to September 2014, and 14.3 million more Uber pickups from January to June 2015. Trip-level data on 10 other for-hire vehicle (FHV) companies, as well as aggregated data for 329 FHV companies, is also included. All the files are as they were received on August 3, Sept. 15 and Sept. 22, 2015.
FiveThirtyEight obtained the data from the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) by submitting a Freedom of Information Law request on July 20, 2015. The TLC has sent us the data in batches as it continues to review trip data Uber and other HFV companies have submitted to it. The TLC's correspondence with FiveThirtyEight is included in the files TLC_letter.pdf, TLC_letter2.pdf and TLC_letter3.pdf. TLC records requests can be made here.
This data was used for four FiveThirtyEight stories: Uber Is Serving New York‚Äôs Outer Boroughs More Than Taxis Are, Public Transit Should Be Uber‚Äôs New Best Friend, Uber Is Taking Millions Of Manhattan Rides Away From Taxis, and Is Uber Making NYC Rush-Hour Traffic Worse?.
The Data
The dataset contains, roughly, four groups of files:
Uber trip data from 2014 (April - September), separated by month, with detailed location information
Uber trip data from 2015 (January - June), with less fine-grained location information
non-Uber FHV (For-Hire Vehicle) trips. The trip information varies by company, but can include day of trip, time of trip, pickup location, driver's for-hire license number, and vehicle's for-hire license number.
aggregate ride and vehicle statistics for all FHV companies (and, occasionally, for taxi companies)
Uber trip data from 2014
There are six files of raw data on Uber pickups in New York City from April to September 2014. The files are separated by month and each has the following columns:
Date/Time : The date and time of the Uber pickup
Lat : The latitude of the Uber pickup
Lon : The longitude of the Uber pickup
Base : The TLC base company code affiliated with the Uber pickup
These files are named:
uber-raw-data-apr14.csv
uber-raw-data-aug14.csv
uber-raw-data-jul14.csv
uber-raw-data-jun14.csv
uber-raw-data-may14.csv
uber-raw-data-sep14.csv
Uber trip data from 2015
Also included is the file uber-raw-data-janjune-15.csv This file has the following columns:
Dispatching_base_num : The TLC base company code of the base that dispatched the Uber
Pickup_date : The date and time of the Uber pickup
Affiliated_base_num : The TLC base company code affiliated with the Uber pickup
locationID : The pickup location ID affiliated with the Uber pickup
The Base codes are for the following Uber bases:
B02512 : Unter B02598 : Hinter B02617 : Weiter B02682 : Schmecken B02764 : Danach-NY B02765 : Grun B02835 : Dreist B02836 : Drinnen
For coarse-grained location information from these pickups, the file taxi-zone-lookup.csv shows the taxi Zone (essentially, neighborhood) and Borough for each locationID.
Non-Uber FLV trips
The dataset also contains 10 files of raw data on pickups from 10 for-hire vehicle (FHV) companies. The trip information varies by company, but can include day of trip, time of trip, pickup location, driver's for-hire license number, and vehicle's for-hire license number.

This dataset is only a first step in understanding and tackling this problem. It contains text and metadata scraped from 244 websites tagged as ""bullshit"" by the BS Detector Chrome Extension by Daniel Sieradski.
Warning: I did not modify the list of news sources from the BS Detector so as not to introduce my (useless) layer of bias; I'm not an authority on fake news. There may be sources whose inclusion you disagree with. It's up to you to decide how to work with the data and how you might contribute to ""improving it"". The labels of ""bs"" and ""junksci"", etc. do not constitute capital ""t"" Truth. If there are other sources you would like to include, start a discussion. If there are sources you believe should not be included, start a discussion or write a kernel analyzing the data. Or take the data and do something else productive with it.

The dataset contains text and metadata from 244 websites and represents 12,999 posts in total from the past 30 days. The data was pulled using the webhose.io API; because it's coming from their crawler, not all websites identified by the BS Detector are present in this dataset. Each website was labeled according to the BS Detector as documented here. Data sources that were missing a label were simply assigned a label of ""bs"". There are (ostensibly) no genuine, reliable, or trustworthy news sources represented in this dataset (so far), so don't trust anything you read.

From defining fake, biased, and misleading news in the first place to deciding how to take action (a blacklist is not a good answer), there's a lot of information to consider beyond what can be neatly arranged in a CSV file.

This mortality dataset is a record of every death in the country for 2005 through 2015, including detailed information about causes of death and the demographic background of the deceased.
It's been said that ""statistics are human beings with the tears wiped off."" This is especially true with this dataset. Each death record represents somebody's loved one, often connected with a lifetime of memories and sometimes tragically too short.
Putting the sensitive nature of the topic aside, analyzing mortality data is essential to understanding the complex circumstances of death across the country. The US Government uses this data to determine life expectancy and understand how death in the U.S. differs from the rest of the world. Whether you‚Äôre looking for macro trends or analyzing unique circumstances, we challenge you to use this dataset to find your own answers to one of life‚Äôs great mysteries.
Overview
This dataset is a collection of CSV files each containing one year's worth of data and paired JSON files containing the code mappings, plus an ICD 10 code set. The CSVs were reformatted from their original fixed-width file formats using information extracted from the CDC's PDF manuals using this script. Please note that this process may have introduced errors as the text extracted from the pdf is not a perfect match. If you have any questions or find errors in the preparation process, please leave a note in the forums. We hope to publish additional years of data using this method soon.
A more detailed overview of the data can be found here. You'll find that the fields are consistent within this time window, but some of data codes change every few years. For example, the 113_cause_recode entry 069 only covers ICD codes (I10,I12) in 2005, but by 2015 it covers (I10,I12,I15). When I post data from years prior to 2005, expect some of the fields themselves to change as well.
All data comes from the CDC‚Äôs National Vital Statistics Systems, with the exception of the Icd10Code, which are sourced from the World Health Organization.
Project ideas
The CDC's mortality data was the basis of a widely publicized paper, by Anne Case and Nobel prize winner Angus Deaton, arguing that middle-aged whites are dying at elevated rates. One of the criticisms against the paper is that it failed to properly account for the exact ages within the broad bins available through the CDC's WONDER tool. What do these results look like with exact/not-binned age data?
Similarly, how sensitive are the mortality trends being discussed in the news to the choice of bin-widths?
As noted above, the data preparation process could have introduced errors. Can you find any discrepancies compared to the aggregate metrics on WONDER? If so, please let me know in the forums!
WONDER is cited in numerous economics, sociology, and public health research papers. Can you find any papers whose conclusions would be altered if they used the exact data available here rather than binned data from Wonder?
Differences from the first version of the dataset
This version of the dataset was prepared in a completely different many. This has allowed us to provide a much larger volume of data and ensure that codes are available for every field.
We've replaced the batch of sql files with a single JSON per year. Kaggle's platform currently offer's better support for JSON files, and this keeps the number of files manageable.
A tutorial kernel providing a quick introduction to the new format is available here.

45 episodes across 4 seasons of Monty Python's Flying Circus - all of the scripts broken down into reusable bits.
Content
The data attempts to create a structure around the Flying Circus scripts by breaking actions down into Dialogue (someone is speaking) and Direction (instructions for the actors). Along with each action I have tried to allocate the episode number, episode name, recording date, air date, segment name, name of character and name of actor playing the character.

Inspiration
I scraped the data because I was looking at data sources for doing RNN to generate text based on an existing corpus. While the amount of data available in the Flying Circus scripts is probably not sufficient, there might be some interesting things to do with the data. For example, some Markov chain generated dialogue lines:
Remember, buy Whizzo butter and this dead crab. Yeah, er, I, I personally think this is getting too silly. I don't like the sound of two bricks being bashed together."

The Data
Here's a brief overview of the format of this dataset as uploaded to Kaggle. For a more detailed description, look at the Description section below.
The dataset is split into two sources, A and B: A was collected from the general public via an iPhone app, and B was collected from a clinical trial in hospitals using a digital stethoscope.
The goal of the task is to first (1) identify the locations of heart sounds from the audio, and (2) to classify the heart sounds into one of several categories (normal v. various non-normal heartbeat sounds).
The CSV files provided are: set_a.csv
set_b.csv set_a_timing.csv
The fields for set_a and set_b are as follows:
dataset: a or b
fname: the audio file
label: either ""normal"", blank (for unlabelled data), or one of various categories of abnormal heartbeats
sublabel: in set_b, some recordings are categorized as noisy, meaning they contain non-heart background noise; this field holds information on whether something is e.g. ""noisynormal"" or ""noisymurmur""
The file set_a_timing.csv contains gold-standard timing information for the ""normal"" recordings from Set A. This file contains the following fields:
fname: the audio file
cycle: anywhere from 1 to 19; the heartbeat cycle that the time observation refers to
sound: either S1 or S2; see below for what these mean
location: the time location of this sound, in audio samples
Description
The task, as described by the original authors
Task Overview
Data has been gathered from two sources: (A) from the general public via the iStethoscope Pro iPhone app, provided in Dataset A, and (B) from a clinic trial in hospitals using the digital stethoscope DigiScope, provided in Dataset B.
CHALLENGE 1 - Heart Sound Segmentation
The first challenge is to produce a method that can locate S1(lub) and S2(dub) sounds within audio data, segmenting the Normal audio files in both datasets. To enable your machine learning method to learn we provide the exact location of S1 and S2 sounds for some of the audio files. You need to use them to identify and locate the S1 and S2 sounds of all the heartbeats in the unlabelled group. The locations of sounds are measured in audio samples for better precision. Your method must use the same unit.
CHALLENGE 2 - Heart Sound Classification
The task is to produce a method that can classify real heart audio (also known as ‚Äúbeat classification‚Äù) into one of four categories for Dataset A:
Normal
Murmur
Extra Heart Sound
Artifact
and three classes for Dataset B:
Normal
Murmur
Extrasystole
You may tackle either or both of these challenges. If you can solve the first challenge, the second will be considerably easier! The winner of each challenge will be the method best able to segment and/or classify two sets of unlabelled data into the correct categories after training on both datasets provided below.
[Obviously no longer applicable -- ed.]: The creator of the winning method will receive a WiFi 32Gb iPad as the prize, awarded at a workshop at AISTATS 2012.
The audio files are of varying lengths, between 1 second and 30 seconds (some have been clipped to reduce excessive noise and provide the salient fragment of the sound). Most information in heart sounds is contained in the low frequency components, with noise in the higher frequencies. It is common to apply a low-pass filter at 195 Hz. Fast Fourier transforms are also likely to provide useful information about volume and frequency over time. More domain-specific knowledge about the difference between the categories of sounds is provided below.
Normal Category
In the Normal category there are normal, healthy heart sounds. These may contain noise in the final second of the recording as the device is removed from the body. They may contain a variety of background noises (from traffic to radios). They may also contain occasional random noise corresponding to breathing, or brushing the microphone against clothing or skin. A normal heart sound has a clear ‚Äúlub dub, lub dub‚Äù pattern, with the time from ‚Äúlub‚Äù to ‚Äúdub‚Äù shorter than the time from ‚Äúdub‚Äù to the next ‚Äúlub‚Äù (when the heart rate is less than 140 beats per minute). Note the temporal description of ‚Äúlub‚Äù and ‚Äúdub‚Äù locations over time in the following illustration:
‚Ä¶lub‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.dub‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. lub‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.dub‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. lub‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.dub‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. lub‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.dub‚Ä¶
In medicine we call the lub sound ""S1"" and the dub sound ""S2"". Most normal heart rates at rest will be between about 60 and 100 beats (‚Äòlub dub‚Äôs) per minute. However, note that since the data may have been collected from children or adults in calm or excited states, the heart rates in the data may vary from 40 to 140 beats or higher per minute. Dataset B also contains noisy_normal data - normal data which includes a substantial amount of background noise or distortion. You may choose to use this or ignore it, however the test set will include some equally noisy examples.
Murmur Category
Heart murmurs sound as though there is a ‚Äúwhooshing, roaring, rumbling, or turbulent fluid‚Äù noise in one of two temporal locations: (1) between ‚Äúlub‚Äù and ‚Äúdub‚Äù, or (2) between ‚Äúdub‚Äù and ‚Äúlub‚Äù. They can be a symptom of many heart disorders, some serious. There will still be a ‚Äúlub‚Äù and a ‚Äúdub‚Äù. One of the things that confuses non-medically trained people is that murmurs happen between lub and dub or between dub and lub; not on lub and not on dub. Below, you can find an asterisk* at the locations a murmur may be.
‚Ä¶lub..*...dub‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. lub..*..dub ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. lub..*..dub ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. lub..*..dub ‚Ä¶ or ‚Ä¶lub‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.dub‚Ä¶*‚Ä¶.lub‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. dub‚Ä¶*‚Ä¶.lub ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. dub‚Ä¶**‚Ä¶.lub ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.dub‚Ä¶
Dataset B also contains noisy_murmur data - murmur data which includes a substantial amount of background noise or distortion. You may choose to use this or ignore it, however the test set will include some equally noisy examples
Extra Heart Sound Category (Dataset A)
Extra heart sounds can be identified because there is an additional sound, e.g. a ‚Äúlub-lub dub‚Äù or a ‚Äúlub dub-dub‚Äù. An extra heart sound may not be a sign of disease. However, in some situations it is an important sign of disease, which if detected early could help a person. The extra heart sound is important to be able to detect as it cannot be detected by ultrasound very well. Below, note the temporal description of the extra heart sounds:
‚Ä¶lub.lub‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.dub‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. lub. lub‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.dub‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.lub.lub‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.dub‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. or ‚Ä¶lub‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. dub.dub‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.lub.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.dub.dub‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.lub‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.dub. dub‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Artifact Category (Dataset A)
In the Artifact category there are a wide range of different sounds, including feedback squeals and echoes, speech, music and noise. There are usually no discernable heart sounds, and thus little or no temporal periodicity at frequencies below 195 Hz. This category is the most different from the others. It is important to be able to distinguish this category from the other three categories, so that someone gathering the data can be instructed to try again.
Extrasystole Category (Dataset B)
Extrasystole sounds may appear occasionally and can be identified because there is a heart sound that is out of rhythm involving extra or skipped heartbeats, e.g. a ‚Äúlub-lub dub‚Äù or a ‚Äúlub dub-dub‚Äù. (This is not the same as an extra heart sound as the event is not regularly occuring.) An extrasystole may not be a sign of disease. It can happen normally in an adult and can be very common in children. However, in some situations extrasystoles can be caused by heart diseases. If these diseases are detected earlier, then treatment is likely to be more effective. Below, note the temporal description of the extra heart sounds: ‚Ä¶........lub‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.dub‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. lub. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.dub‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.lub.lub‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.dub‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. or ‚Ä¶lub‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. dub......‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.lub.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶dub.dub‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.lub‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.dub.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Context
I have been recording available different types of data on soccer matches since 2012, live 24/7. The whole database contains more than 350,000 soccer matches held all around the world from over 27,000 teams of more than 180 countries. An all-in-one package including servers, algorithms and its database are now under the ""Analyst Masters"" research platform. The app is also free for everyone to get its predictions on Android Play Store . How could it become useful for a data scientist?
Did you know that,
more than 1000 soccer matches are played in a week?
the average profit of the stock market from its beginning to now has been less than 10% a year? but you can earn at least 10% on a single match in 2 hours and get your profit in cash
It is one of the very rare datasets that you do not need to prove to other companies your method is the most accurate one and get the prize :) . On the other hand you do not have to classify every data point to be rewarded. Just tune or focus to correctly classify only 1% of matches and there you go! Let me give you a simple hint how easily it can become a classification problem rather than a time series prediction:
Example 1: Who wins based on the number of wins in a head 2 head history?
Q) Consider two teams Midtjylland and Randers from Denmark. They have played against each other for very long time. Midtjyland has won Randers over 8 times in the past 10 matches in a 4 year time span. Forget any other complicated algorithm and simply predict who wins this match?
A) That is easy! However, I am also gathering a lot more information than just their history. You can check their head-to-head history and the odds you could get for predicting this match is ""1.73"" check here.
Example 2: Number of Goals based on their history?
Q) Consider two teams ""San Martin S.J."" and ""Rosario Central"" from Argentina. Their odds for wining ""Team 1 (Home)"", ""Draw"" and ""Team 2 (away)"" is [3.16, 3.2, 2.25] respectively. They rank 22 and 13 in their league. They have recently won 45%,35% of their matches in their past 14 matches. Their average head to head goals in their last 7 matches were 1.3 full time (F) and 0.3 until half-time (HT). How many goals do you think they score in their match? (Note that a safe side of number of goals in soccer betting is Over 0.5 goals in HT, Under 1.5 goals in HT, Over 1.5 goals in FT and Under 3.5 goals in FT). Which one do you choose?
A) For sure under 1.5 goals in HT (you get 35%) and under 3.5 goals in FT (you get 30%) . Bingo you get 65% in a single match in 2 hours
Example 3: Based on the money placed for betting on teams who wins the match?
Q) ""Memmingen"" and ""Munich 1860"" are well known in Germany. One of our reliable sources of data is the ratio of money placed on betting from 10 hours before the match until it starts. Assume that the ratio of bets on ""Munich 1860"" to ""Memmingen"" are recorded every hour as below, which team do you think will win?
[bets in $ on Munich 1860]/[bets in $ on Memmingen] : {1.01, 1.02, 1.04, 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.58, 2.3, 2.6, 2.8}
A) in 10 hours the amount of money placed on wining Munich 1860 Vs Memmingen increased from 1.01 to 2.8, who is the winner? Easy again, Munich 1860 that gives you 160% as stated here.
Try the dataset and inspect every strategy you may come up with, as I gave you three reliable examples above. Just perform well enough to predict 15 matches correctly in a row, start with $1000 and you are a millionaire. If you can't be that accurate use the Kelly Criterion to divide your whole money into smaller stakes.
Let me do the math for you, if you can only get 90% accuracy on 1% of data points (10 out of 1000 matches a week) and your average profit on each match is only 20%. You earn (9*20% = 180%) and lose 100% for your error in 10 predictions. Your net profit would be 80% in a week or approximately 12% in a day. if you risk only 33% of your whole money on each match then the daily net profit becomes 4%. I guess you can easily calculate how fast you can progress @ 4% daily accumulative profit.
For sure one needs a live data feed to predict the outcome before the match. If everything goes well and enough users are interested I will open the live feed of data for you in a shared folder of Dropbox saved in CSV.

name : ""name"" of the car
seller : private or dealer
offerType
price : the price on the ad to sell the car
abtest
vehicleType
yearOfRegistration : at which year the car was first registered
gearbox
powerPS : power of the car in PS
model
kilometer : how many kilometers the car has driven
monthOfRegistration : at which month the car was first registered
fuelType
brand
notRepairedDamage : if the car has a damage which is not repaired yet
dateCreated : the date for which the ad at ebay was created
nrOfPictures : number of pictures in the ad (unfortunately this field contains everywhere a 0 and is thus useless (bug in crawler!) )
postalCode

Motivated by Gregory Smith's web scrape of VGChartz Video Games Sales, this data set simply extends the number of variables with another web scrape from Metacritic. Unfortunately, there are missing observations as Metacritic only covers a subset of the platforms. Also, a game may not have all the observations of the additional variables discussed below. Complete cases are ~ 6,900
Content
Alongside the fields: Name, Platform, Year_of_Release, Genre, Publisher, NA_Sales, EU_Sales, JP_Sales, Other_Sales, Global_Sales, we have:-
Critic_score - Aggregate score compiled by Metacritic staff
Critic_count - The number of critics used in coming up with the Critic_score
User_score - Score by Metacritic's subscribers
User_count - Number of users who gave the user_score
Developer - Party responsible for creating the game
Rating - The ESRB ratings

This dataset contains 50000 ranked ladder matches from the Dota 2 data dump created by Opendota. It was inspired by the Dota 2 Matches data published here by Joe Ramir. This is an update and improved version of that dataset. I have kept the same image and a similar title.
Dota 2 is a popular MOBA available as free to play, and can take up thousands of hours of your life. The number of games in this dataset are played about every hour. If you like the data there are an additional 2-3 million matches easily available for download.
The aim of this dataset is to enable the exploration of player behavior, skill estimation, or anything you find interesting. The intent is to create an accessible, and easy to use resource, which can be expanded and modified if needed. As such I am open to a wide variety of suggestions as to what additions or changes to make.
Help getting started
If there is some aspect of this data you would like to explore but seems difficult to get figure out how to work with please feel free to request some starter code in one of the following two Kernels discussion section. I usually check kaggle every day or so. If you post a request about the current data I will try to get something working.

Whats Currently Available
See https://github.com/odota/core/wiki/JSON-Data-Dump for documentaion on data. I have found a few undocumented areas in the data, including the objectives information. player_slot can be used to combine most of the data, and it is available in most of the tables. Additionally all tables include match_id, and some have account_id to make it easier to look at an individual players matches. match_id, and account_id have been reencoded to save a little space. I can upload tables to allow conversion if needed.
matches: contains top level information about each match. see https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/WebAPI/GetMatchDetails#Tower_Status%22tower_status_dire%22:%202047) for interpreting tower and barracks status. Cluster can link matches to geographic region.
players: Individual players are identified by account_id but there is an option to play anonymously and roughly one third of the account_id are not available. Anonymous users have the value of 0 for account_id. Contains totals for kills, deaths, denies, etc. Player action counts are available, and are indicated by variable names beginning with unit_order_. Counts for reasons for acquiring or losing gold, and gaining experience, have prefixes gold_, and xp_.
player_time: Contains last hits, experience, and gold sampled at one minute interval for all players in all matches. The column names indicate the player_slot. For instance xp_t_1 indicates that this column has experience sums for the player in slot one.
teamfights: Start and stop time of teamfights, as well as last death time. Teamfights appear to be all battles with three or more deaths. As such this does not include all battles for the entire match.
teamfights_players : Additional information provided for each player in each teamfight. player_slot can be used to link this back to players.csv
objectives: Gives information on all the objectives completed, by which player and at what time.
chat: All chat for the 50k matches. There is plenty of profanity, and good natured trolling.
test_labels: match_id and radiant_win(as integer 1 or 0)
test_player: full player and match table with hero_id, player_slot, match_id, and account_id
Nov 5th Update
Added several additional tables. None of the previously uploaded data was altered. I plan to add several Kernels in the next week going over how to use the data, and performing some EDA. Many improvements to the player rating method I used are possible for those interested in MMR.
player_ratings contains match counts, win counts, and TrueSkill rating, calculated on 900k matches which occurred prior to other uploaded data. trueskill ratings have two components, mu, which can be interpreted as the skill, with higher value being better, and sigma which is the uncertainty of the rating.
match_outcomes data for ~900k matches used to calculate player ratings. Use this to improve on the ratings I uploaded.
purchase_log item purchase times
ability_upgrade ability upgrade times and levels
cluster_region allows the mapping cluster found in match.csv to geographic region.
patch_dates release dates for various patches, use start_time from match.csv to determine which patch a match was played in.
ability_ids use with ability_upgrades.csv to get the names of upgraded abilities
item_ids use with purchase_log.csv to get the names of purchased items
Kernel showing how player skill was computed: Contains several resources on trueskill rating system.
Past Research
There seem to be some efforts to establish indicators for skillfull play based on specific parts of gameplay. Opendota has many statistics, and some analysis for specific benchmarks at different times in the game. Dotabuff has a lot of information I have not explored it deeply. This is an area to gather more information.
Some possible directions of investigation
Insight from domain experts would also be useful to help clarify what problems are interesting to work on. Some initial task ideas
Predict match outcomes based on aggregates for individual players using only account_id as prior information
Add hero id to this and see if there is a differences in performance
Estimate player skill based on a sample of in game play(this might need an external mmr source or different definition skill)
Create improved indicators of skillful play based game actions to help players target areas for improvement
All of these areas have been worked on, but I am not aware of the most up to date research on dota2 gameplay.
I plan on setting up several different predictive tasks in the upcoming weeks. A test set of an additional 50 to 100 thousand matches with just hero_id, and account_id included along with outcome of the match.
The current dataset seems pretty small for modeling individual players. I would prefer to have a wide range of features instead of a larger dataset for the moment.
Dataset idea for anyone interested in creating their own Dota 2 dataset. It would be useful to have a few full matches available to work on. They would need to be extracted from the .dem replay file to something easily parsed by R and Python as available in kernels. Given the size of a full match data only a few matches would be needed. There are files available from opendota' s website(check for replays). Looking at fine grained match details would potentially allow for the creation of better high level parsed data. I think it would be a lot of work just to get a handle on working with full match data so a sample would be good to have.

Questions
Yearly how many planes crashed? how many people were on board? how many survived? how many died?
Highest number of crashes by operator and Type of aircrafts.
‚ÄòSummary‚Äô field has the details about the crashes. Find the reasons of the crash and categorize them in different clusters i.e Fire, shot down, weather (for the ‚ÄòBlanks‚Äô in the data category can be UNKNOWN) you are open to make clusters of your choice but they should not exceed 7.
Find the number of crashed aircrafts and number of deaths against each category from above step.
Find any interesting trends/behaviors that you encounter when you analyze the dataset.
My solution
The following bar charts display the answers requested by point 1. of the assignment, in particular:
the planes crashed per year
people aboard per year during crashes
people dead per year during crashes
people survived per year during crashes
The following answers regard point 2 of the assignment
Highest number of crashes by operator: Aeroflot with 179 crashes
By Type of aircraft: Douglas DC-3 with 334 crashes
I have identified 7 clusters using k-means clustering technique on a matrix obtained by a text corpus created by using Text Analysis (plain text, remove punctuation, to lower, etc.) The following table summarize for each cluster the number of crashes and death.
Cluster 1: 258 crashes, 6368 deaths
Cluster 2: 500 crashes, 9408 deaths
Cluster 3: 211 crashes, 3513 deaths
Cluster 4: 1014 crashes, 14790 deaths
Cluster 5: 2749 crashes, 58826 deaths
Cluster 6: 195 crashes, 4439 deaths
Cluster 7: 341 crashes, 8135 deaths
The following picture shows clusters using the first 2 principal components:
For each clusters I will summarize the most used words and I will try to identify the causes of the crash
Cluster 1 (258) aircraft, crashed, plane, shortly, taking. No many information about this cluster can be deducted using Text Analysis
Cluster 2 (500) aircraft, airport, altitude, crashed, crew, due, engine, failed, failure, fire, flight, landing, lost, pilot, plane, runway, takeoff, taking. Engine failure on the runway after landing or takeoff
Cluster 3 (211): aircraft, crashed, fog Crash caused by fog
Cluster 4 (1014): aircraft, airport, attempting, cargo, crashed, fire, land, landing, miles, pilot, plane, route, runway, struck, takeoff Struck a cargo during landing or takeoff
Cluster 5 (2749): accident, aircraft, airport, altitude, approach, attempting, cargo, conditions, control, crashed, crew, due, engine, failed, failure, feet, fire, flight, flying, fog, ground, killed, land, landing, lost, low, miles, mountain, pilot. plane, poor, route, runway, short, shortly, struck, takeoff, taking, weather
Struck a cargo due to engine failure or bad weather conditions mainly fog
Cluster 6 (195): aircraft, crashed, engine, failure, fire, flight, left, pilot, plane, runway
Engine failure on the runway
Cluster 7 (341): accident, aircraft, altitude, cargo, control, crashed, crew, due, engine, failure, flight, landing, loss, lost, pilot, plane, takeoff
Engine failure during landing or takeoff

Mass Shootings in the United States of America (1966-2017) The US has witnessed 398 mass shootings in last 50 years that resulted in 1,996 deaths and 2,488 injured. The latest and the worst mass shooting of October 2, 2017 killed 58 and injured 515 so far. The number of people injured in this attack is more than the number of people injured in all mass shootings of 2015 and 2016 combined. The average number of mass shootings per year is 7 for the last 50 years that would claim 39 lives and 48 injured per year.

I‚Äôve consulted several public datasets and web pages to compile this data. Some of the major data sources include Wikipedia, Mother Jones, Stanford, USA Today and other web sources.
Inspiration
With a broken heart, I like to call the attention of my fellow Kagglers to use Machine Learning and Data Sciences to help me explore these ideas:
‚Ä¢ How many people got killed and injured per year?
‚Ä¢ Visualize mass shootings on the U.S map
‚Ä¢ Is there any correlation between shooter and his/her race, gender
‚Ä¢ Any correlation with calendar dates? Do we have more deadly days, weeks or months on average
‚Ä¢ What cities and states are more prone to such attacks
‚Ä¢ Can you find and combine any other external datasets to enrich the analysis, for example, gun ownership by state
‚Ä¢ Any other pattern you see that can help in prediction, crowd safety or in-depth analysis of the event
‚Ä¢ How many shooters have some kind of mental health problem? Can we compare that shooter with general population with same condition
Mass Shootings Dataset Ver 3
This is the new Version of Mass Shootings Dataset. I've added eight new variables:
Incident Area (where the incident took place),
Open/Close Location (Inside a building or open space)
Target (possible target audience or company),
Cause (Terrorism, Hate Crime, Fun (for no obvious reason etc.)
Policeman Killed (how many on duty officers got killed)
Age (age of the shooter)
Employed (Y/N)
Employed at (Employer Name)
Age, Employed and Employed at (3 variables) contain shooter details
Mass Shootings Dataset Ver 4
Quite a few missing values have been added
Mass Shootings Dataset Ver 5
Three more recent mass shootings have been added including the Texas Church shooting of November 5, 2017
I hope it will help create more visualization and extract patterns.

You may have noticed that for a lot of players, their national details are absent (Team and kit number) even though the nationality is listed. This may be attributed to the missing data on fifa sites.
GITHUB PROJECT
There is much more than just 50 attributes by which fifa decides what happens to players over time, how they perform under pressure, how they grow etc. This data obviously would be well hidden by the organisation and thus would be tough to find
Important note for people interested in using the scraping: The site is not uniform and thus the scraping script requires considering a lot of corner cases (i.e. interchanged position of different attributes). Also the script contains proxy preferences which may be removed if not required.
Exploring the data
For starters you can become a scout:
Create attribute dependent or overall best teams
Create the fastest/slowest teams
See which areas of the world provide which attributes (like Africa : Stamina, Pace)
See which players are the best at each position
See which outfield players can play a better role at some other position
See which youngsters have attributes which can be developed
And that is just the beginning. This is the playground.. literally!
Data description
The file FullData.csv contains attributes describing the in game play style and also some of the real statistics such as Nationality etc.
The file PlayerNames.csv contains URLs for different players from their profiles on fifaindex.com. Append the URLs after the base url fifaindex.com.
The compressed file Pictures.zip contains pictures for top 1000 players in Fifa 17.
The compressed file Pictures_f.zip contains pictures for top 139 female players in Fifa 17.
The compressed file ClubPictures.zip contains pictures for emblems of some major clubs in Fifa 17.
Inspiration
I am a huge FIFA fanatic. While playing career mode I realised that I picked great young players early on every single time and since a lot of digital learning relies on how our brain works, I thought scouting great qualities in players would be something that can be worked on. Since then I started working on scraping the website and here is the data. I hope we can build something on it.
With access to players attributes you can become the best scout in the world. Go for it!"
Netflix Prize data,Dataset from Netflix's competition to improve their reccommendation algorithm,Netflix,131,"Version 1,2017-07-20","film

Netflix held the Netflix Prize open competition for the best algorithm to predict user ratings for films. The grand prize was $1,000,000 and was won by BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos team. This is the dataset that was used in that competition.
Content
This comes directly from the README:
TRAINING DATASET FILE DESCRIPTION
The file ""training_set.tar"" is a tar of a directory containing 17770 files, one per movie. The first line of each file contains the movie id followed by a colon. Each subsequent line in the file corresponds to a rating from a customer and its date in the following format:
CustomerID,Rating,Date
MovieIDs range from 1 to 17770 sequentially.
CustomerIDs range from 1 to 2649429, with gaps. There are 480189 users.
Ratings are on a five star (integral) scale from 1 to 5.
Dates have the format YYYY-MM-DD.
MOVIES FILE DESCRIPTION
Movie information in ""movie_titles.txt"" is in the following format:
MovieID,YearOfRelease,Title
MovieID do not correspond to actual Netflix movie ids or IMDB movie ids.
YearOfRelease can range from 1890 to 2005 and may correspond to the release of corresponding DVD, not necessarily its theaterical release.
Title is the Netflix movie title and may not correspond to titles used on other sites. Titles are in English.
QUALIFYING AND PREDICTION DATASET FILE DESCRIPTION
The qualifying dataset for the Netflix Prize is contained in the text file ""qualifying.txt"". It consists of lines indicating a movie id, followed by a colon, and then customer ids and rating dates, one per line for that movie id. The movie and customer ids are contained in the training set. Of course the ratings are withheld. There are no empty lines in the file.
MovieID1:
CustomerID11,Date11
CustomerID12,Date12
...
MovieID2:
CustomerID21,Date21
CustomerID22,Date22
For the Netflix Prize, your program must predict the all ratings the customers gave the movies in the qualifying dataset based on the information in the training dataset.
The format of your submitted prediction file follows the movie and customer id, date order of the qualifying dataset. However, your predicted rating takes the place of the corresponding customer id (and date), one per line.
For example, if the qualifying dataset looked like:
111:
3245,2005-12-19
5666,2005-12-23
6789,2005-03-14
225:
1234,2005-05-26
3456,2005-11-07
then a prediction file should look something like:
111:
3.0
3.4
4.0
225:
1.0
2.0
which predicts that customer 3245 would have rated movie 111 3.0 stars on the 19th of Decemeber, 2005, that customer 5666 would have rated it slightly higher at 3.4 stars on the 23rd of Decemeber, 2005, etc.
You must make predictions for all customers for all movies in the qualifying dataset.
THE PROBE DATASET FILE DESCRIPTION
To allow you to test your system before you submit a prediction set based on the qualifying dataset, we have provided a probe dataset in the file ""probe.txt"". This text file contains lines indicating a movie id, followed by a colon, and then customer ids, one per line for that movie id.
MovieID1:
CustomerID11
CustomerID12
...
MovieID2:
CustomerID21
CustomerID22
Like the qualifying dataset, the movie and customer id pairs are contained in the training set. However, unlike the qualifying dataset, the ratings (and dates) for each pair are contained in the training dataset.
If you wish, you may calculate the RMSE of your predictions against those ratings and compare your RMSE against the Cinematch RMSE on the same data. See http://www.netflixprize.com/faq#probe for that value.

Synthetic Financial Datasets For Fraud Detection,Synthetic datasets generated by the PaySim mobile money simulator,TESTIMON @ NTNU,127,"Version 2,2017-04-03|Version 1,2017-03-31","crime

There is a lack of public available datasets on financial services and specially in the emerging mobile money transactions domain. Financial datasets are important to many researchers and in particular to us performing research in the domain of fraud detection. Part of the problem is the intrinsically private nature of financial transactions, that leads to no publicly available datasets.
We present a synthetic dataset generated using the simulator called PaySim as an approach to such a problem. PaySim uses aggregated data from the private dataset to generate a synthetic dataset that resembles the normal operation of transactions and injects malicious behaviour to later evaluate the performance of fraud detection methods.
Content
PaySim simulates mobile money transactions based on a sample of real transactions extracted from one month of financial logs from a mobile money service implemented in an African country. The original logs were provided by a multinational company, who is the provider of the mobile financial service which is currently running in more than 14 countries all around the world.
This synthetic dataset is scaled down 1/4 of the original dataset and it is created just for Kaggle.
Headers
This is a sample of 1 row with headers explanation:
1,PAYMENT,1060.31,C429214117,1089.0,28.69,M1591654462,0.0,0.0,0,0
step - maps a unit of time in the real world. In this case 1 step is 1 hour of time. Total steps 744 (30 days simulation).
type - CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT and TRANSFER.
amount - amount of the transaction in local currency.
nameOrig - customer who started the transaction
oldbalanceOrg - initial balance before the transaction
newbalanceOrig - new balance after the transaction
nameDest - customer who is the recipient of the transaction
oldbalanceDest - initial balance recipient before the transaction. Note that there is not information for customers that start with M (Merchants).
newbalanceDest - new balance recipient after the transaction. Note that there is not information for customers that start with M (Merchants).
isFraud - This is the transactions made by the fraudulent agents inside the simulation. In this specific dataset the fraudulent behavior of the agents aims to profit by taking control or customers accounts and try to empty the funds by transferring to another account and then cashing out of the system.
isFlaggedFraud - The business model aims to control massive transfers from one account to another and flags illegal attempts. An illegal attempt in this dataset is an attempt to transfer more than 200.000 in a single transaction.
Past Research
There are 5 similar files that contain the run of 5 different scenarios. These files are better explained at my PhD thesis chapter 7 (PhD Thesis Available here http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:bth-12932).
We ran PaySim several times using random seeds for 744 steps, representing each hour of one month of real time, which matches the original logs. Each run took around 45 minutes on an i7 intel processor with 16GB of RAM. The final result of a run contains approximately 24 million of financial records divided into the 5 types of categories: CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT and TRANSFER.

This dataset is a processed version of the YouTube Faces Dataset, that basically contained short videos of celebrities that are publicly available and were downloaded from YouTube. There are multiple videos of each celebrity (up to 6 videos per celebrity). I've cropped the original videos around the faces, plus kept only consecutive frames of up to 240 frames for each original video. This is done also for reasons of disk space, but mainly to make the dataset easier to use.
Additionally, for this kaggle version of the dataset I've extracted facial keypoints for each frame of each video using this amazing 2D and 3D Face alignment library that was recently published. please check out this video demonstrating the library. It's performance is really amazing, and I feel I'm quite qualified to say that after manually curating many thousands of individual frames and their corresponding keypoints. I removed all videos with extremely bad keypoints labeling. The end result of my curation process is approximately 2800 videos. Right now only 1293 of those videos are uploaded due to dataset size limitations (10GB), but since overall this totals into 155,560 single image frames, I think this is more than enough to do a lot of interesting kernels as well as potentially very interesting research.
Context
Kaggle datasets platform and its integration with kernels is really amazing, but it's yet to have a videos dataset (at least that I'm aware of). Videos are special in the fact that they contain rich spatial patterns (in this case images of human faces) and rich temporal patterns (in this case how the faces move in time).
I was also inspired by the Face Images with Marked Landmark Points dataset uploaded by DrGuillermo and decided to create and share a dataset that would be similar but would also add something extra.

Also, I would like to thank Gil Levi for pointing out YouTube Faces to me a few years back.
Inspiration
The YouTube Faces Dataset was originally intended to be used for face recognition across videos, i.e. given two videos, are those videos of the same person or not?
I think it can be used to serve many additional goals, especially when combined with the keypoints information. For example, can we build a face movement model and predict what facial expression will come next?
This dataset can also be used to test transfer learning between other face datasets (like Face Images with Marked Landmark Points that I mentioned earlier), or even other types of faces like cat or dog faces (like here or here). Also, using the pre-trained Keras models might be useful (example kernel).

The data describe the change in flux (light intensity) of several thousand stars. Each star has a binary label of 2 or 1. 2 indicated that that the star is confirmed to have at least one exoplanet in orbit; some observations are in fact multi-planet systems.
As you can imagine, planets themselves do not emit light, but the stars that they orbit do. If said star is watched over several months or years, there may be a regular 'dimming' of the flux (the light intensity). This is evidence that there may be an orbiting body around the star; such a star could be considered to be a 'candidate' system. Further study of our candidate system, for example by a satellite that captures light at a different wavelength, could solidify the belief that the candidate can in fact be 'confirmed'.
In the above diagram, a star is orbited by a blue planet. At t = 1, the starlight intensity drops because it is partially obscured by the planet, given our position. The starlight rises back to its original value at t = 2. The graph in each box shows the measured flux (light intensity) at each time interval.

The data presented here are cleaned and are derived from observations made by the NASA Kepler space telescope. The Mission is ongoing - for instance data from Campaign 12 was released on 8th March 2017. Over 99% of this dataset originates from Campaign 3. To boost the number of exoplanet-stars in the dataset, confirmed exoplanets from other campaigns were also included.
To be clear, all observations from Campaign 3 are included. And in addition to this, confirmed exoplanet-stars from other campaigns are also included.
The datasets were prepared late-summer 2016.
Campaign 3 was used because 'it was felt' that this Campaign is unlikely to contain any undiscovered (i.e. wrongly labelled) exoplanets.
NASA open-sources the original Kepler Mission data and it is hosted at the Mikulski Archive. After being beamed down to Earth, NASA applies de-noising algorithms to remove artefacts generated by the telescope. The data - in the .fits format - is stored online. And with the help of a seasoned astrophysicist, anyone with an internet connection can embark on a search to find and retrieve the datafiles from the Archive.

Blockchain technology, first implemented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 as a core component of Bitcoin, is a distributed, public ledger recording transactions. Its usage allows secure peer-to-peer communication by linking blocks containing hash pointers to a previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency (cryptocurrency) which leverages the Blockchain to store transactions in a distributed manner in order to mitigate against flaws in the financial industry.
Nearly ten years after its inception, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies experienced an explosion in popular awareness. The value of Bitcoin, on the other hand, has experienced more volatility. Meanwhile, as use cases of Bitcoin and Blockchain grow, mature, and expand, hype and controversy have swirled.

While it's understood that students from elite colleges tend to earn more than graduates from less prestigious universities, the finer relationships between future income and university attendance are quite murky. In an effort to make educational investments less speculative, the US Department of Education has matched information from the student financial aid system with federal tax returns to create the College Scorecard dataset.
Kaggle is hosting the College Scorecard dataset in order to facilitate shared learning and collaboration. Insights from this dataset can help make the returns on higher education more transparent and, in turn, more fair.
Data Description
Here's a script showing an exploratory overview of some of the data.
college-scorecard-release-*.zip contains a compressed version of the same data available through Kaggle Scripts.
It consists of three components:
All the raw data files released in version 1.40 of the college scorecard data
Scorecard.csv, a single CSV file with all the years data combined. In it, we've converted categorical variables represented by integer keys in the original data to their labels and added a Year column
database.sqlite, a SQLite database containing a single Scorecard table that contains the same information as Scorecard.csv

We collected EEG signal data from 10 college students while they watched MOOC video clips. We extracted online education videos that are assumed not to be confusing for college students, such as videos of the introduction of basic algebra or geometry. We also prepare videos that are expected to confuse a typical college student if a student is not familiar with the video topics like Quantum Mechanics, and Stem Cell Research. We prepared 20 videos, 10 in each category. Each video was about 2 minutes long. We chopped the two-minute clip in the middle of a topic to make the videos more confusing. The students wore a single-channel wireless MindSet that measured activity over the frontal lobe. The MindSet measures the voltage between an electrode resting on the forehead and two electrodes (one ground and one reference) each in contact with an ear. After each session, the student rated his/her confusion level on a scale of 1-7, where one corresponded to the least confusing and seven corresponded to the most confusing. These labels if further normalized into labels of whether the students are confused or not. This label is offered as self-labelled confusion in addition to our predefined label of confusion.
Data information:
-----data.csv
Column 1: Subject ID
Column 2: Video ID
Column 3: Attention (Proprietary measure of mental focus)
Column 4: Mediation (Proprietary measure of calmness)
Column 5: Raw (Raw EEG signal)

Column 7: Theta (4-7 Hz of power spectrum)
Column 8: Alpha 1 (Lower 8-11 Hz of power spectrum)
Column 9: Alpha 2 (Higher 8-11 Hz of power spectrum)
Column 10: Beta 1 (Lower 12-29 Hz of power spectrum)
Column 11: Beta 2 (Higher 12-29 Hz of power spectrum)
Column 12: Gamma 1 (Lower 30-100 Hz of power spectrum)
Column 13: Gamma 2 (Higher 30-100 Hz of power spectrum)
Column 14: predefined label (whether the subject is expected to be confused)
Column 15: user-defined label (whether the subject is actually confused)
-----subject demographic
Column 1: Subject ID
Column 2: Age
Column 3: Ethnicity (Categorized according to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_contemporary_ethnic_groups)
Column 4: Gender
-----video data
Each video lasts roughly two-minute long, we remove the first 30 seconds and last 30 seconds, only collect the EEG data during the middle 1 minute.
Format
These data are collected from ten students, each watching ten videos.
Therefore, it can be seen as only 100 data points for these 12000+ rows. If you look at this way, then each data point consists of 120+ rows, which is sampled every 0.5 seconds (so each data point is a one minute video). Signals with higher frequency are reported as the mean value during each 0.5 second.

Data Collection
The data is collected from a software that we implemented ourselves. Check HaohanWang/Bioimaging for the source code.
Inspiration
This dataset is an extremely challenging data set to perform binary classification. 65% of prediction accuracy is quite decent according to our experience.
It is an interesting data set to carry out the variable selection (causal inference) task that may help further research. Past research has indicated that Theta signal is correlated with confusion level.
It is also an interesting data set for confounding factors correction model because we offer two labels (subject id and video id) that could profoundly confound the results.
Warning
The data for subject 3 might be corrupted.

It contains expression values for ~12.000 proteins for each sample, with missing values present when a given protein could not be quantified in a given sample.
Content:
File: 77_cancer_proteomes_CPTAC_itraq.csv
RefSeq_accession_number: RefSeq protein ID (each protein has a unique ID in a RefSeq database)
gene_symbol: a symbol unique to each gene (every protein is encoded by some gene)

First column ""Complete TCGA ID"" is used to match the sample IDs in the main cancer proteomes file (see example script). All other columns have self-explanatory names, contain data about the cancer classification of a given sample using different methods. 'PAM50 mRNA' classification is being used in the example script.
File: PAM50_proteins.csv
Contains the list of genes and proteins used by the PAM50 classification system. The column RefSeqProteinID contains the protein IDs that can be matched with the IDs in the main protein expression data set.
Past Research: The original study: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v534/n7605/full/nature18003.html (paywall warning)
In brief: the data were used to assess how the mutations in the DNA are affecting the protein expression landscape in breast cancer. Genes in our DNA are first transcribed into RNA molecules which then are translated into proteins. Changing the information content of DNA has impact on the behavior of the proteome, which is the main functional unit of cells, taking care of cell division, DNA repair, enzymatic reactions and signaling etc. They performed K-means clustering on the protein data to divide the breast cancer patients into sub-types, each having unique protein expression signature. They found that the best clustering was achieved using 3 clusters (original PAM50 gene set yields four different subtypes using RNA data).
Inspiration:
This is an interesting study and I myself wanted to use this breast cancer proteome data set for other types of analyses using machine learning that I am performing as a part of my PhD. However, I though that the Kaggle community (or at least that part with biomedical interests) would enjoy playing with it. I added a simple K-means clustering example for that data with some comments, the same approach as used in the original paper. One thing is that there is a panel of genes, the PAM50 which is used to classify breast cancers into subtypes. This panel was originally based on the RNA expression data which is (in my opinion) not as robust as the measurement of mRNA's final product, the protein. Perhaps using this data set, someone could find a different set of proteins (they all have unique NP_/XP_ identifiers) that would divide the data set even more robustly? Perhaps into a higher numbers of clusters with very distinct protein expression signatures?

These are the lyrics for 57650 songs. They can be used for Natural Language Processing purposes, such as clustering of the words with similar meanings or predicting artist by the song. The dataset can be expanded with some more features for more advanced research like sentiment analysis. The data is not modified, only slightly cleaned, which gives a lot of freedom to devise your own applications.
Mining
I have mined this dataset as a corpus for my NLP studies. However, before performing any transformation to bag-of-words or bag-of-N-grams, I decided to share the data. The data has been acquired from LyricsFreak through scraping. Then I did some very basic work on removing inconvenient data: non-English lyrics, extremely short and extremely long lyrics, lyrics with non-ASCII symbols. However, there's still work to be done in terms of data preparation.

Dataset Information:
This is an educational data set which is collected from learning management system (LMS) called Kalboard 360. Kalboard 360 is a multi-agent LMS, which has been designed to facilitate learning through the use of leading-edge technology. Such system provides users with a synchronous access to educational resources from any device with Internet connection.
The data is collected using a learner activity tracker tool, which called experience API (xAPI). The xAPI is a component of the training and learning architecture (TLA) that enables to monitor learning progress and learner‚Äôs actions like reading an article or watching a training video. The experience API helps the learning activity providers to determine the learner, activity and objects that describe a learning experience. The dataset consists of 480 student records and 16 features. The features are classified into three major categories: (1) Demographic features such as gender and nationality. (2) Academic background features such as educational stage, grade Level and section. (3) Behavioral features such as raised hand on class, opening resources, answering survey by parents, and school satisfaction.
The dataset consists of 305 males and 175 females. The students come from different origins such as 179 students are from Kuwait, 172 students are from Jordan, 28 students from Palestine, 22 students are from Iraq, 17 students from Lebanon, 12 students from Tunis, 11 students from Saudi Arabia, 9 students from Egypt, 7 students from Syria, 6 students from USA, Iran and Libya, 4 students from Morocco and one student from Venezuela.
The dataset is collected through two educational semesters: 245 student records are collected during the first semester and 235 student records are collected during the second semester.
The data set includes also the school attendance feature such as the students are classified into two categories based on their absence days: 191 students exceed 7 absence days and 289 students their absence days under 7.
This dataset includes also a new category of features; this feature is parent parturition in the educational process. Parent participation feature have two sub features: Parent Answering Survey and Parent School Satisfaction. There are 270 of the parents answered survey and 210 are not, 292 of the parents are satisfied from the school and 188 are not.

Stock market data can be interesting to analyze and as a further incentive, strong predictive models can have large financial payoff. The amount of financial data on the web is seemingly endless. A large and well structured dataset on a wide array of companies can be hard to come by. Here I provide a dataset with historical stock prices (last 5 years) for all companies currently found on the S&P 500 index.
The script I used to acquire all of these .csv files can be found in this GitHub repository In the future if you wish for a more up to date dataset, this can be used to acquire new versions of the .csv files.
Feb 2018 note: I have just updated the dataset to include data up to Feb 2018. I have also accounted for changes in the stocks on the S&P 500 index (RIP whole foods etc. etc.).
Content
The data is presented in a couple of formats to suit different individual's needs or computational limitations. I have included files containing 5 years of stock data (in the all_stocks_5yr.csv and corresponding folder).
The folder individual_stocks_5yr contains files of data for individual stocks, labelled by their stock ticker name. The all_stocks_5yr.csv contains the same data, presented in a merged .csv file. Depending on the intended use (graphing, modelling etc.) the user may prefer one of these given formats.
All the files have the following columns: Date - in format: yy-mm-dd
Open - price of the stock at market open (this is NYSE data so all in USD)
High - Highest price reached in the day
Low Close - Lowest price reached in the day
Volume - Number of shares traded
Name - the stock's ticker name
Acknowledgements
Due to volatility in google finance, for the newest version I have switched over to acquiring the data from The Investor's Exchange api, the simple script I use to do this is found here. Special thanks to Kaggle, Github, pandas_datareader and The Market.
Inspiration
This dataset lends itself to a some very interesting visualizations. One can look at simple things like how prices change over time, graph an compare multiple stocks at once, or generate and graph new metrics from the data provided. From these data informative stock stats such as volatility and moving averages can be easily calculated. The million dollar question is: can you develop a model that can beat the market and allow you to make statistically informed trades!"

This file contains a List of Risk Factors for Cervical Cancer leading to a Biopsy Examination!
About 11,000 new cases of invasive cervical cancer are diagnosed each year in the U.S. However, the number of new cervical cancer cases has been declining steadily over the past decades. Although it is the most preventable type of cancer, each year cervical cancer kills about 4,000 women in the U.S. and about 300,000 women worldwide. In the United States, cervical cancer mortality rates plunged by 74% from 1955 - 1992 thanks to increased screening and early detection with the Pap test. AGE Fifty percent of cervical cancer diagnoses occur in women ages 35 - 54, and about 20% occur in women over 65 years of age. The median age of diagnosis is 48 years. About 15% of women develop cervical cancer between the ages of 20 - 30. Cervical cancer is extremely rare in women younger than age 20. However, many young women become infected with multiple types of human papilloma virus, which then can increase their risk of getting cervical cancer in the future. Young women with early abnormal changes who do not have regular examinations are at high risk for localized cancer by the time they are age 40, and for invasive cancer by age 50. SOCIOECONOMIC AND ETHNIC FACTORS Although the rate of cervical cancer has declined among both Caucasian and African-American women over the past decades, it remains much more prevalent in African-Americans -- whose death rates are twice as high as Caucasian women. Hispanic American women have more than twice the risk of invasive cervical cancer as Caucasian women, also due to a lower rate of screening. These differences, however, are almost certainly due to social and economic differences. Numerous studies report that high poverty levels are linked with low screening rates. In addition, lack of health insurance, limited transportation, and language difficulties hinder a poor woman‚Äôs access to screening services. HIGH SEXUAL ACTIVITY Human papilloma virus (HPV) is the main risk factor for cervical cancer. In adults, the most important risk factor for HPV is sexual activity with an infected person. Women most at risk for cervical cancer are those with a history of multiple sexual partners, sexual intercourse at age 17 years or younger, or both. A woman who has never been sexually active has a very low risk for developing cervical cancer. Sexual activity with multiple partners increases the likelihood of many other sexually transmitted infections (chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis).Studies have found an association between chlamydia and cervical cancer risk, including the possibility that chlamydia may prolong HPV infection. FAMILY HISTORY Women have a higher risk of cervical cancer if they have a first-degree relative (mother, sister) who has had cervical cancer. USE OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES Studies have reported a strong association between cervical cancer and long-term use of oral contraception (OC). Women who take birth control pills for more than 5 - 10 years appear to have a much higher risk HPV infection (up to four times higher) than those who do not use OCs. (Women taking OCs for fewer than 5 years do not have a significantly higher risk.) The reasons for this risk from OC use are not entirely clear. Women who use OCs may be less likely to use a diaphragm, condoms, or other methods that offer some protection against sexual transmitted diseases, including HPV. Some research also suggests that the hormones in OCs might help the virus enter the genetic material of cervical cells. HAVING MANY CHILDREN Studies indicate that having many children increases the risk for developing cervical cancer, particularly in women infected with HPV. SMOKING Smoking is associated with a higher risk for precancerous changes (dysplasia) in the cervix and for progression to invasive cervical cancer, especially for women infected with HPV. IMMUNOSUPPRESSION Women with weak immune systems, (such as those with HIV / AIDS), are more susceptible to acquiring HPV. Immunocompromised patients are also at higher risk for having cervical precancer develop rapidly into invasive cancer. DIETHYLSTILBESTROL (DES) From 1938 - 1971, diethylstilbestrol (DES), an estrogen-related drug, was widely prescribed to pregnant women to help prevent miscarriages. The daughters of these women face a higher risk for cervical cancer. DES is no longer prsecribed."

Ray Kroc wanted to build a restaurant system that would be famous for providing food of consistently high quality and uniform methods of preparation. He wanted to serve burgers, buns, fries and beverages that tasted just the same in Alaska as they did in Alabama. To achieve this, he chose a unique path: persuading both franchisees and suppliers to buy into his vision, working not for McDonald‚Äôs but for themselves, together with McDonald‚Äôs. Many of McDonald‚Äôs most famous menu items ‚Äì like the Big Mac, Filet-O-Fish, and Egg McMuffin ‚Äì were created by franchisees.

The objective is to classify activities into one of the six activities performed.
Description of experiment
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
Attribute information
For each record in the dataset the following is provided:
Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
Its activity label.
An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The Ethereum blockchain gives a revolutionary way of decentralized applications and provides its own cryptocurrency. Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference. These apps run on a custom built blockchain, an enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the ownership of property. This enables developers to create markets, store registries of debts or promises, move funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past (like a will or a futures contract) and many other things that have not been invented yet, all without a middle man or counterparty risk.

Lower back pain can be caused by a variety of problems with any parts of the complex, interconnected network of spinal muscles, nerves, bones, discs or tendons in the lumbar spine. Typical sources of low back pain include:
The large nerve roots in the low back that go to the legs may be irritated
The smaller nerves that supply the low back may be irritated
The large paired lower back muscles (erector spinae) may be strained
The bones, ligaments or joints may be damaged
An intervertebral disc may be degenerating
An irritation or problem with any of these structures can cause lower back pain and/or pain that radiates or is referred to other parts of the body. Many lower back problems also cause back muscle spasms, which don't sound like much but can cause severe pain and disability.
While lower back pain is extremely common, the symptoms and severity of lower back pain vary greatly. A simple lower back muscle strain might be excruciating enough to necessitate an emergency room visit, while a degenerating disc might cause only mild, intermittent discomfort.

The data
This dataset shares publicly available data related to the ongoing Zika epidemic. It is being provided as a resource to the scientific community engaged in the public health response. The data provided here is not official and should be considered provisional and non-exhaustive. The data in reports may change over time, reflecting delays in reporting or changes in classifications. And while accurate representation of the reported data is the objective in the machine readable files shared here, that accuracy is not guaranteed. Before using any of these data, it is advisable to review the original reports and sources, which are provided whenever possible along with further information on the CDC Zika epidemic GitHub repo.
The dataset includes the following fields:
report_date - The report date is the date that the report was published. The date should be specified in standard ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).
location - A location is specified for each observation following the specific names specified in the country place name database. This may be any place with a 'location_type' as listed below, e.g. city, state, country, etc. It should be specified at up to three hierarchical levels in the following format: [country]-[state/province]-[county/municipality/city], always beginning with the country name. If the data is for a particular city, e.g. Salvador, it should be specified: Brazil-Bahia-Salvador.
location_type - A location code is included indicating: city, district, municipality, county, state, province, or country. If there is need for an additional 'location_type', open an Issue to create a new 'location_type'.
data_field - The data field is a short description of what data is represented in the row and is related to a specific definition defined by the report from which it comes.
data_field_code - This code is defined in the country data guide. It includes a two letter country code (ISO-3166 alpha-2, list), followed by a 4-digit number corresponding to a specific report type and data type.
time_period - Optional. If the data pertains to a specific period of time, for example an epidemiological week, that number should be indicated here and the type of time period in the 'time_period_type', otherwise it should be NA.
time_period_type - Required only if 'time_period' is specified. Types will also be specified in the country data guide. Otherwise should be NA.
value - The observation indicated for the specific 'report_date', 'location', 'data_field' and when appropriate, 'time_period'.
unit - The unit of measurement for the 'data_field'. This should conform to the 'data_field' unit options as described in the country-specific data guide.

This data publication contains a spatial database of wildfires that occurred in the United States from 1992 to 2015. It is the third update of a publication originally generated to support the national Fire Program Analysis (FPA) system. The wildfire records were acquired from the reporting systems of federal, state, and local fire organizations. The following core data elements were required for records to be included in this data publication: discovery date, final fire size, and a point location at least as precise as Public Land Survey System (PLSS) section (1-square mile grid). The data were transformed to conform, when possible, to the data standards of the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG). Basic error-checking was performed and redundant records were identified and removed, to the degree possible. The resulting product, referred to as the Fire Program Analysis fire-occurrence database (FPA FOD), includes 1.88 million geo-referenced wildfire records, representing a total of 140 million acres burned during the 24-year period.

Plan
Data collected from the (up to) 200 listed trending YouTube videos every day in the US and the UK.
Description
The dataset includes data gathered from videos on YouTube that are contained within the trending category each day.
There are two kinds of data files, one includes comments and one includes video statistics. They are linked by the unique video_id field.
The headers in the video file are:
video_id (Common id field to both comment and video csv files)
title
channel_title
category_id (Can be looked up using the included JSON files, but varies per region so use the appropriate JSON file for the CSV file's country)
tags (Separated by | character, [none] is displayed if there are no tags)
views
likes
dislikes
thumbnail_link
date (Formatted like so: [day].[month])
The headers in the comments file are:
video_id (Common id field to both comment and video csv files)
comment_text
likes
replies
Extra info: The YouTube API is not effective at formatting comments by relevance, although it claims to do so. As a result, the most relevant comments do not align with the top comments at all, they aren't even sorted by likes or replies.
Inspiration
Possible uses for this dataset could include:
Sentiment analysis in a variety of forms
Categorising YouTube videos based on their comments and statistics.
Training ML algorithms to generate their own YouTube comments.
Analysing what factors affect how popular a YouTube video will be.
Although there are likely many more possibilities, including analysis of changes over time etc."

What surprising insights can you find in this data? We look forward to seeing and sharing what you discover on scripts!
Data Description
Here''s a data dictionary.
There are two types of survey data provided, housing and population.
For the housing data, each row is a housing unit, and the characteristics are properties like rented vs. owned, age of home, etc.
For the population data, each row is a person and the characteristics are properties like age, gender, whether they work, method/length of commute, etc.
Each data set is divided in two pieces, ""a"" and ""b"" (where ""a"" contains states 1 to 25 and ""b"" contains states 26 to 50).
Both data sets have weights associated with them. Weights are included to account for the fact that individuals are not sampled with equal probably (people who have a greater chance of being sampled have a lower weight to reflect this).
Weight variable for the housing data: WGTP
Weight variable for the population data: PWGTP
In Kaggle Scripts, these files can be accessed at:

Based on this data, here are some useful ways of deriving insights and analysis:
Social Network Cluster Analysis: Who are the major players in the pro-ISIS twitter network? Ideally, we would like this visualized via a cluster network with the biggest influencers scaled larger than smaller influencers.
Keyword Analysis: Which keywords derived from the name, username, description, location, and tweets were the most commonly used by ISIS fanboys? Examples include: ""baqiyah"", ""dabiq"", ""wilayat"", ""amaq""
Data Categorization of Links: Which websites are pro-ISIS fanboys linking to? Categories include: Mainstream Media, Altermedia, Jihadist Websites, Image Upload, Video Upload,
Sentiment Analysis: Which clergy do pro-ISIS fanboys quote the most and which ones do they hate the most? Search the tweets for names of prominent clergy and classify the tweet as positive, negative, or neutral and if negative, include the reasons why. Examples of clergy they like the most: ""Anwar Awlaki"", ""Ahmad Jibril"", ""Ibn Taymiyyah"", ""Abdul Wahhab"". Examples of clergy that they hate the most: ""Hamza Yusuf"", ""Suhaib Webb"", ""Yaser Qadhi"", ""Nouman Ali Khan"", ""Yaqoubi"".

At any given point, Indiegogo has around 10,000 live campaigns while Kickstarter has 6,000. It has become increasingly difficult for projects to stand out of the crowd. Of course, advertisements via various channels are by far the most important factor to a successful campaign. However, for creators with a smaller budget, this leaves them wonder,

1 million Sudoku games,1 million numpy array pairs of Sudoku games and solutions,Kyubyong Park,74,"Version 3,2016-12-29|Version 2,2016-12-28|Version 1,2016-12-27",games and toys,CSV,156 MB,CC0,"28,707 views","1,584 downloads",20 kernels,3 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/bryanpark/sudoku,"Context
Sudoku is a popular number puzzle that requires you to fill blanks in a 9X9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3√ó3 subgrids contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. Sudoku-solving has gained much attention from various fields. As a deep learning researcher, I was inclined to investigate the possibilities of neural networks solving Sudoku. This dataset was prepared for that.
Content
There are dozens of source codes to generate Sudoku games available. I picked one of them, and ran the code. It took approximately 6 hours to generate 1 million games ( + solutions).
A Sudoku puzzle is represented as a 9x9 Python numpy array. The blanks were replaced with 0's. You can easily load and explore the data by running this.
import numpy as np
quizzes = np.load('sudoku_quizzes.npy') # shape = (1000000, 9, 9)
solutions = np.load('sudoku_solutions.npy') # shape = (1000000, 9, 9)
for quiz, solution in zip(quizzes[:10], solutions[:10]):
    print(quiz)
    print(solution)
** Updates for Version 3. **
I converted NumPy arrays to csv so they are easily accessible, irrespective of language. In each line, a Sudoku quiz and its corresponding solution are separated by a comma. You can restore the csv file content to Numpy arrays if needed as follows:
import numpy as np
quizzes = np.zeros((1000000, 81), np.int32)
solutions = np.zeros((1000000, 81), np.int32)
for i, line in enumerate(open('sudoku.csv', 'r').read().splitlines()[1:]):
    quiz, solution = line.split("","")
    for j, q_s in enumerate(zip(quiz, solution)):
        q, s = q_s
        quizzes[i, j] = q
        solutions[i, j] = s
quizzes = quizzes.reshape((-1, 9, 9))
solutions = solutions.reshape((-1, 9, 9))

Accidental death by fatal drug overdose is a rising trend in the United States. What can you do to help?
This dataset contains summaries of prescription records for 250 common opioid and non-opioid drugs written by 25,000 unique licensed medical professionals in 2014 in the United States for citizens covered under Class D Medicare as well as some metadata about the doctors themselves. This is a small subset of data that was sourced from cms.gov. The full dataset contains almost 24 million prescription instances in long format. I have cleaned and compiled this data here in a format with 1 row per prescriber and limited the approximately 1 million total unique prescribers down to 25,000 to keep it manageable. If you are interested in more data, you can get the script I used to assemble the dataset here and run it yourself. The main data is in prescriber-info.csv. There is also opioids.csv that contains the names of all opioid drugs included in the data and overdoses.csv that contains information on opioid related drug overdose fatalities.
The increase in overdose fatalities is a well-known problem, and the search for possible solutions is an ongoing effort. My primary interest in this dataset is detecting sources of significant quantities of opiate prescriptions. However, there is plenty of other studies to perform, and I am interested to see what other Kagglers will come up with, or if they can improve the model I have already built.
The data consists of the following characteristics for each prescriber
NPI ‚Äì unique National Provider Identifier number
Gender - (M/F)
State - U.S. State by abbreviation
Credentials - set of initials indicative of medical degree
Specialty - description of type of medicinal practice
A long list of drugs with numeric values indicating the total number of prescriptions written for the year by that individual

The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese ""Vinho Verde"" wine. For more details, consult the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).
These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).
This dataset is also available from the UCI machine learning repository, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality , I just shared it to kaggle for convenience. (If I am mistaken and the public license type disallowed me from doing so, I will take this down if requested.)
Content
For more information, read [Cortez et al., 2009].
Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
1 - fixed acidity
2 - volatile acidity
3 - citric acid
4 - residual sugar
5 - chlorides
6 - free sulfur dioxide
7 - total sulfur dioxide
8 - density
9 - pH
10 - sulphates
11 - alcohol
Output variable (based on sensory data):
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
Tips
What might be an interesting thing to do, is aside from using regression modelling, is to set an arbitrary cutoff for your dependent variable (wine quality) at e.g. 7 or higher getting classified as 'good/1' and the remainder as 'not good/0'. This allows you to practice with hyper parameter tuning on e.g. decision tree algorithms looking at the ROC curve and the AUC value. Without doing any kind of feature engineering or overfitting you should be able to get an AUC of .88 (without even using random forest algorithm)
KNIME is a great tool (GUI) that can be used for this.
1 - File Reader (for csv) to linear correlation node and to interactive histogram for basic EDA.
2- File Reader to 'Rule Engine Node' to turn the 10 point scale to dichtome variable (good wine and rest), the code to put in the rule engine is something like this:
- $quality$ > 6.5 => ""good""
- TRUE => ""bad""
3- Rule Engine Node output to input of Column Filter node to filter out your original 10point feature (this prevent leaking)
4- Column Filter Node output to input of Partitioning Node (your standard train/tes split, e.g. 75%/25%, choose 'random' or 'stratified')
5- Partitioning Node train data split output to input of Train data split to input Decision Tree Learner node and
6- Partitioning Node test data split output to input Decision Tree predictor Node
7- Decision Tree learner Node output to input Decision Tree Node input
8- Decision Tree output to input ROC Node.. (here you can evaluate your model base on AUC value)

Use machine learning to determine which physiochemical properties make a wine 'good'!

The dataset is designed to allow for different methods to be tested for examining the trends in CT image data associated with using contrast and patient age. The basic idea is to identify image textures, statistical patterns and features correlating strongly with these traits and possibly build simple tools for automatically classifying these images when they have been misclassified (or finding outliers which could be suspicious cases, bad measurements, or poorly calibrated machines)
Data
The data are a tiny subset of images from the cancer imaging archive. They consist of the middle slice of all CT images taken where valid age, modality, and contrast tags could be found. This results in 475 series from 69 different patients.

Who is the best team of all time
What trends have there been in international football throughout the ages - home advantage, total goals scored, distribution of teams' strength etc
Can we say anything about geopolitics from football fixtures - how has the number of countries changed, which teams like to play each other
Which countries host the most matches where they themselves are not participating in
How much, if at all, does hosting a major tournament help a country's chances in said tournament
Which teams are the most active in playing friendlies and friendly tournaments - does it help or harm them

To better follow the energy consumption, the government wants energy suppliers to install smart meters in every home in England, Wales and Scotland. There are more than 26 million homes for the energy suppliers to get to, with the goal of every home having a smart meter by 2020.
This roll out of meter is lead by the European Union who asked all member governments to look at smart meters as part of measures to upgrade our energy supply and tackle climate change. After an initial study, the British government decided to adopt smart meters as part of their plan to update our ageing energy system.
In this dataset, you will find a refactorised version of the data from the London data store, that contains the energy consumption readings for a sample of 5,567 London Households that took part in the UK Power Networks led Low Carbon London project between November 2011 and February 2014. The data from the smart meters seems associated only to the electrical consumption.

The UK government amassed traffic data from 2000 and 2016, recording over 1.6 million accidents in the process and making this one of the most comprehensive traffic data sets out there. It's a huge picture of a country undergoing change.
Note that all the contained accident data comes from police reports, so this data does not include minor incidents.
Content
ukTrafficAADF.csv tracks how much traffic there was on all major roads in the given time period (2000 through 2016). AADT, the core statistic included in this file, stands for ""Average Annual Daily Flow"", and is a measure of how activity a road segment based on how many vehicle trips traverse it. The AADT page on Wikipedia is a good reference on the subject.
Accidents data is split across three CSV files: accidents_2005_to_2007.csv, accidents_2009_to_2011.csv, and accidents_2012_to_2014.csv. These three files together constitute 1.6 million traffic accidents. The total time period is 2005 through 2014, but 2008 is missing.

How has changing traffic flow impacted accidents?
Can we predict accident rates over time? What might improve accident rates?
Plot interactive maps of changing trends, e.g. How has London has changed for cyclists? Busiest roads in the nation?
Which areas never change and why? Identify infrastructure needs, failings and successes.
How have Rural and Urban areas differed (see RoadCategory)? How about the differences between England, Scotland, and Wales?
The UK government also like to look at miles driven. You can do this by multiplying the AADF by the corresponding length of road (link length) and by the number of days in the years. What does this tell you about UK roads?"

Description of fnlwgt (final weight)
The weights on the Current Population Survey (CPS) files are controlled to independent estimates of the civilian noninstitutional population of the US. These are prepared monthly for us by Population Division here at the Census Bureau. We use 3 sets of controls. These are:
A single cell estimate of the population 16+ for each state.
Controls for Hispanic Origin by age and sex.
Controls by Race, age and sex.
We use all three sets of controls in our weighting program and ""rake"" through them 6 times so that by the end we come back to all the controls we used. The term estimate refers to population totals derived from CPS by creating ""weighted tallies"" of any specified socio-economic characteristics of the population. People with similar demographic characteristics should have similar weights. There is one important caveat to remember about this statement. That is that since the CPS sample is actually a collection of 51 state samples, each with its own probability of selection, the statement only applies within state.

Inspiration: Probably one of the hardest things to do is pick stocks and horses. I have been involved in the stocks and horses industry for many years and through publishing previous libraries and software I have met many interesting people and also one of my long term clients/friends.
I am currently trying enhance my software development skills by learning data science / machine learning.
I have a done a few tutorials and I am hoping that by publishing this data I can learn and collaborate with members of the Kaggle Community.

Cancer Inhibitors,Predict small molecules' activity targeting protein kinase,Kelvin Xiao,68,"Version 4,2016-10-28|Version 3,2016-10-26|Version 2,2016-09-03|Version 1,2016-09-02",healthcare,Other,2 GB,CC4,"18,371 views","1,912 downloads",34 kernels,6 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/xiaotawkaggle/inhibitors,"Outline
It was reported that an estimated 4292,000 new cancer cases and 2814,000 cancer deaths would occur in China in 2015. Chen, W., etc. (2016), Cancer statistics in China, 2015.
Small molecules play an non-trivial role in cancer chemotherapy. Here I focus on inhibitors of 8 protein kinases(name: abbr):
Cyclin-dependent kinase 2: cdk2
Epidermal growth factor receptor erbB1: egfr_erbB1
Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta: gsk3b
Hepatocyte growth factor receptor: hgfr
MAP kinase p38 alpha: map_k_p38a
Tyrosine-protein kinase LCK: tpk_lck
Tyrosine-protein kinase SRC: tpk_src
Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2: vegfr2
For each protein kinase, several thousand inhibitors are collected from chembl database, in which molecules with IC50 lower than 10 uM are usually considered as inhibitors, otherwise non-inhibitors.
Challenge
Based on those labeled molecules, build your model, and try to make the right prediction.
Additionally, more than 70,000 small molecules are generated from pubchem database. And you can screen these molecules to find out potential inhibitors. P.S. the majority of these molecules are non-inhibitors.
DataSets(hdf5 version)
There are 8 protein kinase files and 1 pubchem negative samples file. Taking ""cdk2.h5"" as an example:
import h5py
from scipy import sparse
hf = h5py.File(""../input/cdk2.h5"", ""r"")
ids = hf[""chembl_id""].value # the name of each molecules
ap = sparse.csr_matrix((hf[""ap""][""data""], hf[""ap""][""indices""], hf[""ap""][""indptr""]), shape=[len(hf[""ap""][""indptr""]) - 1, 2039])
mg = sparse.csr_matrix((hf[""mg""][""data""], hf[""mg""][""indices""], hf[""mg""][""indptr""]), shape=[len(hf[""mg""][""indptr""]) - 1, 2039])
tt = sparse.csr_matrix((hf[""tt""][""data""], hf[""tt""][""indices""], hf[""tt""][""indptr""]), shape=[len(hf[""tt""][""indptr""]) - 1, 2039])
features = sparse.hstack([ap, mg, tt]).toarray() # the samples' features, each row is a sample, and each sample has 3*2039 features
labels = hf[""label""].value # the label of each molecule"

How important is nutrition information for today's college kids? Is their taste in food defined by their food preferences when they were children? Are kids of parents who cook more likely to make better food choices than others? Are these kids likely to have a different taste compared to others?

Detailed NFL Play-by-Play Data 2015,An NFL dataset generated by the nflscrapR R-package & primed for analysis,Max Horowitz,64,"Version 2,2016-10-03|Version 1,2016-05-21",american football,CSV,15 MB,Other,"33,699 views","3,321 downloads",86 kernels,8 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2015,"Introduction
The lack of publicly available National Football League (NFL) data sources has been a major obstacle in the creation of modern, reproducible research in football analytics. While clean play-by-play data is available via open-source software packages in other sports (e.g. nhlscrapr for hockey; PitchF/x data in baseball; the NBA API for basketball), the equivalent datasets are not freely available for researchers interested in the statistical analysis of the NFL. To solve this issue, a group of Carnegie Mellon University statistical researchers led by recent graduate, Maksim Horowitz, built and released nflscrapR an R package which uses an API maintained by the NFL to scrape, clean, parse, and output clean datasets at the individual play, player, game, and season levels. These datasets allow for the advancement of NFL research in the public domain by allowing analysts to develop from a common source in order to create reproducible NFL research, similar to what is being done currently in other professional sports.
2015 NFL Play-by-Play Dataset
The dataset made available on Kaggle contains all the regular season plays from the 2015-2016 NFL season. The dataset contain 46,129 rows and 63 columns. Each play is broken down into great detail containing information on; game situation, players involved and results. Detailed information about the dataset can be found in the nflscrapR documentation.
Downloading and Installing nflscrapR:
Use the following code in your R console:
# Must install the devtools package using the below code
install.packages('devtools')

Pok√©mon for Data Mining and Machine Learning,(Almost) all Pok√©mon stats until generation 6: 21 variables per Pok√©mon,alopez247,64,"Version 2,2017-03-05|Version 1,2017-01-08",video games,CSV,800 KB,CC4,"69,501 views","2,256 downloads",30 kernels,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/alopez247/pokemon,"Context
With the rise of the popularity of machine learning, this is a good opportunity to share a wide database of the even more popular video-game Pok√©mon by Nintendo, Game freak, and Creatures, originally released in 1996.
Pok√©mon started as a Role Playing Game (RPG), but due to its increasing popularity, its owners ended up producing many TV series, manga comics, and so on, as well as other types of video-games (like the famous Pok√©mon Go!).
This dataset is focused on the stats and features of the Pok√©mon in the RPGs. Until now (08/01/2017) seven generations of Pok√©mon have been published. All in all, this dataset does not include the data corresponding to the last generation, since 1) I created the databased when the seventh generation was not released yet, and 2) this database is a modification+extension of the database ""721 Pokemon with stats"" by Alberto Barradas (https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon), which does not include (of course) the latest generation either.
Content
This database includes 21 variables per each of the 721 Pok√©mon of the first six generations, plus the Pok√©mon ID and its name. These variables are briefly described next:
Number. Pok√©mon ID in the Pok√©dex.
Name. Name of the Pok√©mon.
Type_1. Primary type.
Type_2. Second type, in case the Pok√©mon has it.
Total. Sum of all the base stats (Health Points, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed).
HP. Base Health Points.
Attack. Base Attack.
Defense. Base Defense.
Sp_Atk. Base Special Attack.
Sp_Def. Base Special Defense.
Speed. Base Speed.
Generation. Number of the generation when the Pok√©mon was introduced.
isLegendary. Boolean that indicates whether the Pok√©mon is Legendary or not.
Color. Color of the Pok√©mon according to the Pok√©dex.
hasGender. Boolean that indicates if the Pok√©mon can be classified as female or male.
Pr_male. In case the Pok√©mon has Gender, the probability of its being male. The probability of being female is, of course, 1 minus this value.
Egg_Group_1. Egg Group of the Pok√©mon.
Egg_Group_2. Second Egg Group of the Pok√©mon, in case it has two.
hasMegaEvolution. Boolean that indicates whether the Pok√©mon is able to Mega-evolve or not.
Height_m. Height of the Pok√©mon, in meters.
Weight_kg. Weight of the Pok√©mon, in kilograms.
Catch_Rate. Catch Rate.
Body_Style. Body Style of the Pok√©mon according to the Pok√©dex.
Notes
Please note that many Pok√©mon are multi-form, and also some of them can Mega-evolve. I wanted to keep the structure of the dataset as simple and general as possible, as well as the Number variable (the ID of the Pok√©mon) unique. Hence, in the cases of the multi-form Pok√©mon, or the ones capable of Mega-evolve, I just chose one of the forms, the one I (and my brother) considered the standard and/or the most common. The specific choice for each of this Pok√©mon are shown below:
Mega-Evolutions are not considered as Pok√©mon.
Kyogre, Groudon. Primal forms not considered.
Deoxis. Only normal form considered.
Wormadam. Only plant form considered.
Rotom. Only normal form considered, the one with types Electric and Ghost.
Giratina. Origin form considered.
Shaymin. Land form considered.
Darmanitan. Standard mode considered.
Tornadus, Thundurus, Landorus. Incarnate form considered.
Kyurem. Normal form considered, not white or black forms.
Meloetta. Aria form considered.
Mewstic. Both female and male forms are equal in the considered variables.
Aegislash. Shield form considered.
Pumpkaboo, Gourgeist. Average size considered.
Zygarde. 50% form considered.
Hoopa. Confined form considered.
Acknowledgements
As said at the beginning, this database was based on the Kaggle database ""721 Pokemon with stats"" by Alberto Barradas (https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon). The other resources I mainly used are listed below:
WikiDex (http://es.pokemon.wikia.com/wiki/WikiDex).
Bulbapedia, the community driven Pok√©mon encyclopedia (http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page).
Smogon University (http://www.smogon.com/).
Possible future work
This dataset can be used with different objectives, such as, Pok√©mon clustering, trying to find relations or dependencies between the variables, and also for supervised classification purposes, where the class could be the Primary Type, but also many of the other variables.

Ships in Satellite Imagery,Classify ships in San Franciso Bay using Planet satellite imagery,rhammell,64,"Version 7,2017-11-14|Version 6,2017-10-16|Version 5,2017-10-11|Version 4,2017-10-11|Version 3,2017-10-10|Version 2,2017-10-09|Version 1,2017-10-09",business,Other,148 MB,CC4,"8,227 views",954 downloads,9 kernels,3 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/rhammell/ships-in-satellite-imagery,"Context
Satellite imagery provides unique insights into various markets, including agriculture, defense and intelligence, energy, and finance. New commercial imagery providers, such as Planet and BlackSky, are using constellations of small satellites to exponentially increase the amount of images of the earth captured every day.
This flood of new imagery is outgrowing the ability for organizations to manually look at each image that gets captured, and there is a need for machine learning and computer vision algorithms to help automate the analysis process.
The aim of this dataset is to help address the difficult task of detecting the location of large ships in satellite images. Automating this process can be applied to many issues including monitoring port activity levels and supply chain analysis.
Continusouly updates will be made to this dataset as new Planet imagery released. Current images were collected as late as September 2017.
Content
The dataset consists of image chips extracted from Planet satellite imagery collected over the San Franciso Bay area. It includes 2800 80x80 RGB images labeled with either a ""ship"" or ""no-ship"" classification. Image chips were derived from PlanetScope full-frame visual scene products, which are orthorectified to a 3 meter pixel size.
Provided is a zipped directory shipsnet.7z that contains the entire dataset as .png image chips. Each individual image filename follows a specific format: {label} __ {scene id} __ {longitude} _ {latitude}.png
label: Valued 1 or 0, representing the ""ship"" class and ""no-ship"" class, respectively.
scene id: The unique identifier of the PlanetScope visual scene the image chip was extracted from. The scene id can be used with the Planet API to discover and download the entire scene.
longitude_latitude: The longitude and latitude coordinates of the image center point, with values separated by a single underscore.
The dataset is also distributed as a JSON formatted text file shipsnet.json. The loaded object contains data, label, scene_ids, and location lists.
The pixel value data for each 80x80 RGB image is stored as a list of 19200 integers within the data list. The first 6400 entries contain the red channel values, the next 6400 the green, and the final 6400 the blue. The image is stored in row-major order, so that the first 80 entries of the array are the red channel values of the first row of the image.
The list values at index i in labels, scene_ids, and locations each correspond to the i-th image in the data list.
Class Labels
The ""ship"" class includes 700 images. Images in this class are near-centered on the body of a single ship. Ships of different ship sizes, orientations, and atmospheric collection conditions are included. Example images from this class are shown below.
The ""no-ship"" class includes 2100 images. A third of these are a random sampling of different landcover features - water, vegetion, bare earth, buildings, etc. - that do not include any portion of an ship. The next third are ""partial ships"" that contain only a portion of an ship, but not enough to meet the full definition of the ""ship"" class. The last third are images that have previously been mislabeled by machine learning models, typically caused by bright pixels or strong linear features. Example images from this class are shown below.
Acknowledgements
Satellite imagery used to build this dataset is made available through Planet's Open California dataset, which is openly licensed. As such, this dataset is also available under the same CC-BY-SA license. Users can sign up for a free Planet account to search, view, and download thier imagery and gain access to their API."

Quora's first public dataset is related to the problem of identifying duplicate questions. At Quora, an important product principle is that there should be a single question page for each logically distinct question. For example, the queries ‚ÄúWhat is the most populous state in the USA?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhich state in the United States has the most people?‚Äù should not exist separately on Quora because the intent behind both is identical. Having a canonical page for each logically distinct query makes knowledge-sharing more efficient in many ways: for example, knowledge seekers can access all the answers to a question in a single location, and writers can reach a larger readership than if that audience was divided amongst several pages.
The dataset is based on actual data from Quora and will give anyone the opportunity to train and test models of semantic equivalence.
Content
There are over 400,000 lines of potential question duplicate pairs. Each line contains IDs for each question in the pair, the full text for each question, and a binary value that indicates whether the line truly contains a duplicate pair.

TLDR
The directory 1-1-16_5-31-17_Weather contains 1663 files (one for each of the 1663 stations in Japan)
As its name implies, the data is from the same date window as the competition's date_info file
If a station file's name ends with four underscores and a date, the date indicates when the station was terminated
Please, read on...
Context
This dataset contains the dataset from the Recruit Restaurant Visitor Forecasting competition (active from 11-28-17 to 2-6-18).
The focus is on using data about reservations made at various restaurants throughout Japan, along with restaurant location and genre information to predict the actual number of visitors a restaurant will have on a given day.
This dataset augments the above with the addition of information about the weather at various locations in Japan over time to produce an exciting, multi-faceted dataset that deals with time, geography, weather, and delicious food.
Thank you for your interest in this dataset! Please let me know if you have any suggestions, questions or problems!
Content
The core of the dataset comprises the files in the following directory:
1-1-16_5-31-17_Weather (1663 .csv files):
This directory contains translated weather data for the time period denoted by the directory‚Äôs name (from 1-1-16 through 5-31-17).
Each .csv file in this directory is of shape (517, 15), and is named according to the id values in the below weather_stations file.
There are a few reasons why there may seem to be a lot of null values:
The primary reason is that different types of stations/sensors are used, and some just don't capture as much data as others
Questionable data is sometimes removed by the Agency
If the station was terminated, its values are null
These are the features for all translated weather files (I won‚Äôt hazard a description for the features that aren‚Äôt already self-explanatory because I‚Äôm no meteorologist, and I‚Äôd hate for you to get that impression):
calendar_date - the observation date, formatted thusly ""yyyy-mm-dd""
avg_temperature
high_temperature
low_temperature
precipitation
hours_sunlight
solar_radiation
deepest_snowfall
total_snowfall
avg_wind_speed
avg_vapor_pressure
avg_local_pressure
avg_humidity
avg_sea_pressure
cloud_cover
This dataset adds the following .csv files regarding weather stations, and their relations to the competition data:
weather_stations.csv (1663, 8):
This file contains the location and termination dates for 1,663 weather stations in Japan.
id - the join of a station‚Äôs prefecture, first_name, and second_name, with ""__"" (double underscores)
Note: If date_terminated is not null, id will end with four underscores and the date_terminated
prefecture - the prefecture in which this station is located (see note 1)
first_name - the first name given to specify a location (see note 2)
second_name - the second name given to specify a location (see note 2)
latitude - latitude of the station, converted from degrees, minutes, seconds to decimal degrees for consistency
longitude - longitude of the station, converted from degrees, minutes, seconds to decimal degrees for consistency
altitude - altitude of the station
date_terminated - If the station was terminated, the date of its termination (formatted thusly ""yyyy-mm-dd"") else null
nearby_active_stations.csv (62, 8):
This file is a subset of weather_stations.csv (above) selected via the following criteria:
    1) the station was not terminated, and
    2) the station was the closest station to at least one store in air_store_info or hpg_store_info
As you can see, there is a lot of overlap here, because while the weather stations seem to generally be scattered throughout Japan, the store locations tend to be clustered around several areas.
Column names and descriptions are identical to those of weather_stations.
feature_manifest.csv (1663, 15):
This file contains information about each station's ""coverage"" of each weather feature.
Values of 0.0 for any of the below features except id mean that station collected no data on that feature.
Values of 1.0 for any of the below features except id mean that station collected data on that feature for every day.
id - the id of this weather station
avg_temperature - ratio of non-null values for this feature at this station
high_temperature - ratio of non-null values for this feature at this station
low_temperature - ratio of non-null values for this feature at this station
precipitation - ratio of non-null values for this feature at this station
hours_sunlight - ratio of non-null values for this feature at this station
solar_radiation - ratio of non-null values for this feature at this station
deepest_snowfall - ratio of non-null values for this feature at this station
total_snowfall - ratio of non-null values for this feature at this station
avg_wind_speed - ratio of non-null values for this feature at this station
avg_vapor_pressure - ratio of non-null values for this feature at this station
avg_local_pressure - ratio of non-null values for this feature at this station
avg_humidity - ratio of non-null values for this feature at this station
avg_sea_pressure - ratio of non-null values for this feature at this station
cloud_cover - ratio of non-null values for this feature at this station
air_station_distances.csv (1663, 111):
This file contains the Vincenty distance from every weather station to every unique latitude/longitude pair in the air system.
station_id - the id of this weather station
station_latitude - station latitude (in decimal degrees)
station_longitude - station longitude (in decimal degrees)
<<UNIQUE AIR COORDINATE PAIRS>> - The remaining 108 columns are stringified versions of all unique air coordinate pairs
They are formatted thusly: (##.###, ##.###), where the first float is the store latitude and the second is the store longitude (see note 3)
EX) The first of these columns is: (34.6951242, 135.1978525)
hpg_station_distances.csv (1663, 132):
This file contains the Vincenty distance from every weather station to every unique latitude/longitude pair in the hpg system.
station_id - the id of this weather station
station_latitude - station latitude (in decimal degrees)
station_longitude - station longitude (in decimal degrees)
<<UNIQUE HPG COORDINATE PAIRS>> - The remaining 129 columns are stringified versions of all unique hpg coordinate pairs
They are formatted thusly: (##.###, ##.###), where the first float is the store latitude and the second is the store longitude (see note 3)
EX) The first of these columns is: (35.6436746642265, 139.668220854814)
air_store_info_with_nearest_active_station.csv (829, 12):
hpg_store_info_with_nearest_active_station.csv (4690, 12):
These two files are supplemented versions of air_store_info and hpg_store_info, and they contain the original competition data for the store_info file specified in the file‚Äôs name, plus the following features:
latitude_str - a stringified version of this store's latitude for lookup in air_station_distances and hpg_station_distances
longitude_str - a stringified version of this store's longitude for lookup in air_station_distances and hpg_station_distances
station_id - the id of the weather station nearest to this store
station_latitude - the latitude (in decimal degrees) of the weather station nearest to this store
station_longitude - the longitude (in decimal degrees) of the weather station nearest to this store
station_vincenty - the Vincenty distance between this store and the station to which it is closest
station_great_circle - the Great Circle distance between this store and the station to which it is closest
Other Available Data
Date ranges outside of the one used for this competition
Records seem to go fairly far back, but of course the data we can actually get will be subject to the activation and termination dates of each individual station
Observation periods other than daily values
Hourly, every ‚Äúx‚Äù days, monthly, seasonal
Option to compare data with average from the past 30 years
Other features:
Day‚Äôs maximum instantaneous wind speed

Disclaimers
The site has one station (that I know of) that I did not include in the list of all stations. That station is located in the Antarctic, and I didn‚Äôt include it because the Antarctic is not located in Japan
I have not tested the feasibility of actually gathering and processing the ‚Äúother available data‚Äù listed above
Below is a list of my qualifications for processing weather data for Japan, from a site written in Japanese:

Look upon the list and see that it is empty. I‚Äôm just a guy that knows how to get stuff done and enjoys a challenge
Again, read all translations with several grains of salt
Plans/Ideas to Expand This Dataset (Tell Me If These Interest You)
Getting data from previous years to get a better idea of how the weather should be on a given day (next version)
Averaging data from multiple stations to maybe create some representation of the weather for that prefecture/area
For stores that are particularly far from their nearest station, doing a similar sort of averaging as above to attempt to minimize any risk posed by using weather data too far from the target store
Notes
1) The site separates the prefecture ""Hokkaido"" into its 14 subprefectures:
Therefore, when you might expect prefecture to be ""hokkaido"", you will actually see ""hokkaido_<subprefecture>""
i.e., the concatenation of the three strings ""hokkaido"", ""_"" (single underscore), and the subprefecture name
2) Formatting of first_name and last_name:
Spaces were replaced by ""-"" (single dash)
If a value was not provided or could not be translated, the value is ""NONE""
I would suggest you don‚Äôt rely too heavily on these features, as they are the result of several different translation APIs, which were rarely in agreement on the translation. These features are provided more as a convenience, and in an effort to give you as much data as possible
3) Column formatting in air_station_distances.csv and hpg_station_distances.csv:
These files show the coordinates with the precision shown in the original air_store_info.csv and hpg_store_info.csv files; however, Pandas, doesn't read these values in with the same precision
If you plan on using these files, you must use the latitude_str and longitude_str features in the appropriate ..._store_info_with_nearest_active_station file to look up coordinates

Pokemon holds a very special place in my heart as it is probably the only video game I have judiciously followed for more than 10 years. With this dataset, I wanted to be able to answer the following questions:
Is it possible to build a classifier to identify legendary Pokemon?
How does height and weight of a Pokemon correlate with its various base stats?
What factors influence the Experience Growth and Egg Steps? Are these quantities correlated?
Which type is the strongest overall? Which is the weakest?
Which type is the most likely to be a legendary Pokemon?
Can you build a Pokemon dream team? A team of 6 Pokemon that inflicts the most damage while remaining relatively impervious to any other team of 6 Pokemon."

Census of India is a rich database which can tell stories of over a billion Indians. It is important not only for research point of view, but commercially as well for the organizations that want to understand India's complex yet strongly knitted heterogeneity. However, nowhere on the web, there exists a single database that combines the district- wise information of all the variables (most include no more than 4-5 out of over 50 variables!). Extracting and using data from Census of India 2001 is quite a laborious task since all data is made available in scattered PDFs district wise. Individual PDFs can be extracted from http://www.censusindia.gov.in/(S(ogvuk1y2e5sueoyc5eyc0g55))/Tables_Published/Basic_Data_Sheet.aspx.

All the extraction work can be found @ https://github.com/preetskhalsa97/census2001auto The final CSV can be found at finalCSV/all.csv
The subtle hack that was used to automate extraction to a great extent was the the URLs of all the PDFs were same except the four digits (that were respective state and district codes).

The dataset consists of three files: a file with behaviour data (events.csv), a file with item properties (item_properties.—Åsv) and a file, which describes category tree (category_tree.—Åsv). The data has been collected from a real-world ecommerce website. It is raw data, i.e. without any content transformations, however, all values are hashed due to confidential issues. The purpose of publishing is to motivate researches in the field of recommender systems with implicit feedback.
Content
The behaviour data, i.e. events like clicks, add to carts, transactions, represent interactions that were collected over a period of 4.5 months. A visitor can make three types of events, namely ‚Äúview‚Äù, ‚Äúaddtocart‚Äù or ‚Äútransaction‚Äù. In total there are 2 756 101 events including 2 664 312 views, 69 332 add to carts and 22 457 transactions produced by 1 407 580 unique visitors. For about 90% of events corresponding properties can be found in the ‚Äúitem_properties.csv‚Äù file.
For example:
‚Äú1439694000000,1,view,100,‚Äù means visitorId = 1, clicked the item with id = 100 at 1439694000000 (Unix timestamp)
‚Äú1439694000000,2,transaction,1000,234‚Äù means visitorId = 2 purchased the item with id = 1000 in transaction with id = 234 at 1439694000000 (Unix timestamp)
The file with item properties (item_properties.csv) includes 20 275 902 rows, i.e. different properties, describing 417 053 unique items. File is divided into 2 files due to file size limitations. Since the property of an item can vary in time (e.g., price changes over time), every row in the file has corresponding timestamp. In other words, the file consists of concatenated snapshots for every week in the file with the behaviour data. However, if a property of an item is constant over the observed period, only a single snapshot value will be present in the file. For example, we have three properties for single item and 4 weekly snapshots, like below:
timestamp,itemid,property,value
1439694000000,1,100,1000
1439695000000,1,100,1000
1439696000000,1,100,1000
1439697000000,1,100,1000
1439694000000,1,200,1000
1439695000000,1,200,1100
1439696000000,1,200,1200
1439697000000,1,200,1300
1439694000000,1,300,1000
1439695000000,1,300,1000
1439696000000,1,300,1100
1439697000000,1,300,1100
After snapshot merge it would looks like:
1439694000000,1,100,1000
1439694000000,1,200,1000
1439695000000,1,200,1100
1439696000000,1,200,1200
1439697000000,1,200,1300
1439694000000,1,300,1000
1439696000000,1,300,1100
Because property=100 is constant over time, property=200 has different values for all snapshots, property=300 has been changed once.
Item properties file contain timestamp column because all of them are time dependent, since properties may change over time, e.g. price, category, etc. Initially, this file consisted of snapshots for every week in the events file and contained over 200 millions rows. We have merged consecutive constant property values, so it's changed from snapshot form to change log form. Thus, constant values would appear only once in the file. This action has significantly reduced the number of rows in 10 times.
All values in the ‚Äúitem_properties.csv‚Äù file excluding ""categoryid"" and ""available"" properties were hashed. Value of the ""categoryid"" property contains item category identifier. Value of the ""available"" property contains availability of the item, i.e. 1 means the item was available, otherwise 0. All numerical values were marked with ""n"" char at the beginning, and have 3 digits precision after decimal point, e.g., ""5"" will become ""n5.000"", ""-3.67584"" will become ""n-3.675"". All words in text values were normalized (stemming procedure: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming) and hashed, numbers were processed as above, e.g. text ""Hello world 2017!"" will become ""24214 44214 n2017.000""
The category tree file has 1669 rows. Every row in the file specifies a child categoryId and the corresponding parent. For example:
Line ‚Äú100,200‚Äù means that categoryid=1 has parent with categoryid=200
Line ‚Äú300,‚Äù means that categoryid hasn‚Äôt parent in the tree

Tasks
Task 1
When a customer comes to an e-commerce site, he looks for a product with particular properties: price range, vendor, product type and etc. These properties are implicit, so it's hard to determine them through clicks log.
Try to create an algorithm which predicts properties of items in ""addtocart"" event by using data from ""view"" events for any visitor in the published log.
Task 2
Description:
Process of analyzing ecommerce data include very important part of data cleaning. Researchers noticed that in some cases browsing data include up to 40% of abnormal traffic.
Firstly, abnormal users add a lot of noise into data and make recommendation system less effective. In order to increase efficiency of recommendation system, abnormal users should be removed from the raw data.
Secondly, abnormal users add bias to results of split tests, so this type of users should be removed also from split test data.
Goals:
The main goal is to find abnormal users of e-shop.
Subgoals:
Generate features
Build a model
Create a metric that helps to evaluate quality of the model"

A high-quality, dataset of images containing fruits. The following fruits are included: Apples - (different varieties: Golden, Golden-Red, Granny Smith, Red, Red Delicious), Apricot, Avocado, Avocado ripe, Banana (Yellow, Red), Cactus fruit, Carambula, Cherry, Clementine, Cocos, Dates, Granadilla, Grape (Pink, White, White2), Grapefruit (Pink, White), Guava, Huckleberry, Kiwi, Kaki, Kumsquats, Lemon (normal, Meyer), Lime, Litchi, Mandarine, Mango, Maracuja, Nectarine, Orange, Papaya, Passion fruit, Peach, Pepino, Pear (different varieties, Abate, Monster, Williams), Pineapple, Pitahaya Red, Plum, Pomegranate, Quince, Raspberry, Salak, Strawberry, Tamarillo, Tangelo.
Dataset properties
Training set size: 28736 images.
Validation set size: 9673 images.
Number of classes: 60 (fruits).
Image size: 100x100 pixels.
Filename format: image_index_100.jpg (e.g. 32_100.jpg) or r_image_index_100.jpg (e.g. r_32_100.jpg). ""r"" stands for rotated fruit. ""100"" comes from image size (100x100 pixels).
Different varieties of the same fruit (apple for instance) are shown having different labels.
Content
Fruits were planted in the shaft of a low speed motor (3 rpm) and a short movie of 20 seconds was recorded.
A Logitech C920 camera was used for filming the fruits. This is one of the best webcams available.
Behind the fruits we placed a white sheet of paper as background.
However due to the variations in the lighting conditions, the background was not uniform and we wrote a dedicated algorithm which extract the fruit from the background. This algorithm is of flood fill type: we start from each edge of the image and we mark all pixels there, then we mark all pixels found in the neighborhood of the already marked pixels for which the distance between colors is less than a prescribed value. We repeat the previous step until no more pixels can be marked.
All marked pixels are considered as being background (which is then filled with white) and the rest of pixels are considered as belonging to the object.
The maximum value for the distance between 2 neighbor pixels is a parameter of the algorithm and is set (by trial and error) for each movie.

It contains duplicate ratings (same user_id,book_id), as reported by Philipp Spachtholz in his illustrious notebook.
The current version has duplicates removed, and more ratings (six million), sorted by time. Book and user IDs are the same.
It is available at https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k.
There have been good datasets for movies (Netflix, Movielens) and music (Million Songs) recommendation, but not for books. That is, until now.
This dataset contains ratings for ten thousand popular books. As to the source, let's say that these ratings were found on the internet. Generally, there are 100 reviews for each book, although some have less - fewer - ratings. Ratings go from one to five.
Both book IDs and user IDs are contiguous. For books, they are 1-10000, for users, 1-53424. All users have made at least two ratings. Median number of ratings per user is 8.
There are also books marked to read by the users, book metadata (author, year, etc.) and tags.
Contents
ratings.csv contains ratings and looks like that:
book_id,user_id,rating
1,314,5
1,439,3
1,588,5
1,1169,4
1,1185,4
to_read.csv provides IDs of the books marked ""to read"" by each user, as user_id,book_id pairs.
books.csv has metadata for each book (goodreads IDs, authors, title, average rating, etc.).
The metadata have been extracted from goodreads XML files, available in the third version of this dataset as books_xml.tar.gz. The archive contains 10000 XML files. One of them is available as sample_book.xml. To make the download smaller, these files are absent from the current version. Download version 3 if you want them.
book_tags.csv contains tags/shelves/genres assigned by users to books. Tags in this file are represented by their IDs.
tags.csv translates tag IDs to names.
See the notebook for some basic stats of the dataset.
goodreads IDs
Each book may have many editions. goodreads_book_id and best_book_id generally point to the most popular edition of a given book, while goodreads work_id refers to the book in the abstract sense.

The lack of publicly available National Football League (NFL) data sources has been a major obstacle in the creation of modern, reproducible research in football analytics. While clean play-by-play data is available via open-source software packages in other sports (e.g. nhlscrapr for hockey; PitchF/x data in baseball; the Basketball Reference for basketball), the equivalent datasets are not freely available for researchers interested in the statistical analysis of the NFL. To solve this issue, a group of Carnegie Mellon University statistical researchers including Maksim Horowitz, Ron Yurko, and Sam Ventura, built and released nflscrapR an R package which uses an API maintained by the NFL to scrape, clean, parse, and output clean datasets at the individual play, player, game, and season levels. Using the data outputted by the package, the trio went on to develop reproducible methods for building expected point and win probability models for the NFL. The outputs of these models are included in this dataset and can be accessed using the nflscrapR package.
Content
The dataset made available on Kaggle contains all the regular season plays from the 2009-2016 NFL seasons. The dataset has 356,768 rows and 100 columns. Each play is broken down into great detail containing information on: game situation, players involved, results, and advanced metrics such as expected point and win probability values. Detailed information about the dataset can be found at the following web page, along with more NFL data: https://github.com/ryurko/nflscrapR-data.

The National Park Service publishes a database of animal and plant species identified in individual national parks and verified by evidence ‚Äî observations, vouchers, or reports that document the presence of a species in a park. All park species records are available to the public on the National Park Species portal; exceptions are made for sensitive, threatened, or endangered species when widespread distribution of information could pose a risk to the species in the park.
Content
National Park species lists provide information on the presence and status of species in our national parks. These species lists are works in progress and the absence of a species from a list does not necessarily mean the species is absent from a park. The time and effort spent on species inventories varies from park to park, which may result in data gaps. Species taxonomy changes over time and reflects regional variations or preferences; therefore, records may be listed under a different species name.
Each park species record includes a species ID, park name, taxonomic information, scientific name, one or more common names, record status, occurrence (verification of species presence in park), nativeness (species native or foreign to park), abundance (presence and visibility of species in park), seasonality (season and nature of presence in park), and conservation status (species classification according to US Fish & Wildlife Service). Taxonomic classes have been translated from Latin to English for species categorization; order, family, and scientific name (genus, species, subspecies) are in Latin.

This dataset includes the location, mass, composition, and fall year for over 45,000 meteorites that have struck our planet.
Notes on missing or incorrect data points:
a few entries here contain date information that was incorrectly parsed into the NASA database. As a spot check: any date that is before 860 CE or after 2016 are incorrect; these should actually be BCE years. There may be other errors and we are looking for a way to identify them.
a few entries have latitude and longitude of 0N/0E (off the western coast of Africa, where it would be quite difficult to recover meteorites). Many of these were actually discovered in Antarctica, but exact coordinates were not given. 0N/0E locations should probably be treated as NA.
The starter kernel for this dataset has a quick way to filter out these observations using dplyr in R, provided here for convenience:
meteorites.geo <- meteorites.all %>%
filter(year>=860 & year<=2016) %>% # filter out weird years
filter(reclong<=180 & reclong>=-180 & (reclat!=0 | reclong!=0)) # filter out weird locations
The Data
Note that a few column names start with ""rec"" (e.g., recclass, reclat, reclon). These are the recommended values of these variables, according to The Meteoritical Society. In some cases, there were historical reclassification of a meteorite, or small changes in the data on where it was recovered; this dataset gives the currently recommended values.
The dataset contains the following variables:
name: the name of the meteorite (typically a location, often modified with a number, year, composition, etc)
id: a unique identifier for the meteorite
nametype: one of:
-- valid: a typical meteorite
-- relict: a meteorite that has been highly degraded by weather on Earth
recclass: the class of the meteorite; one of a large number of classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics (see the Wikipedia article on meteorite classification for a primer)
mass: the mass of the meteorite, in grams
fall: whether the meteorite was seen falling, or was discovered after its impact; one of:
-- Fell: the meteorite's fall was observed
-- Found: the meteorite's fall was not observed
year: the year the meteorite fell, or the year it was found (depending on the value of fell)
reclat: the latitude of the meteorite's landing
reclong: the longitude of the meteorite's landing
GeoLocation: a parentheses-enclose, comma-separated tuple that combines reclat and reclong
What can we do with this data?
Here are a couple of thoughts on questions to ask and ways to look at this data:
how does the geographical distribution of observed falls differ from that of found meteorites? -- this would be great overlaid on a cartogram or alongside a high-resolution population density map
are there any geographical differences or differences over time in the class of meteorites that have fallen to Earth?

National Institutes of Health Chest X-Ray Dataset
Chest X-ray exams are one of the most frequent and cost-effective medical imaging examinations available. However, clinical diagnosis of a chest X-ray can be challenging and sometimes more difficult than diagnosis via chest CT imaging. The lack of large publicly available datasets with annotations means it is still very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve clinically relevant computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) in real world medical sites with chest X-rays. One major hurdle in creating large X-ray image datasets is the lack resources for labeling so many images. Prior to the release of this dataset, Openi was the largest publicly available source of chest X-ray images with 4,143 images available.
This NIH Chest X-ray Dataset is comprised of 112,120 X-ray images with disease labels from 30,805 unique patients. To create these labels, the authors used Natural Language Processing to text-mine disease classifications from the associated radiological reports. The labels are expected to be >90% accurate and suitable for weakly-supervised learning. The original radiology reports are not publicly available but you can find more details on the labeling process in this Open Access paper: ""ChestX-ray8: Hospital-scale Chest X-ray Database and Benchmarks on Weakly-Supervised Classification and Localization of Common Thorax Diseases."" (Wang et al.)
Link to paper

Data limitations:
The image labels are NLP extracted so there could be some erroneous labels but the NLP labeling accuracy is estimated to be >90%.
Very limited numbers of disease region bounding boxes (See BBox_list_2017.csv)
Chest x-ray radiology reports are not anticipated to be publicly shared. Parties who use this public dataset are encouraged to share their ‚Äúupdated‚Äù image labels and/or new bounding boxes in their own studied later, maybe through manual annotation

Stars mostly form in clusters and associations rather than in isolation. Milky Way star clusters are easily observable with small telescopes, and in some cases even with the naked eye. Depending on a variety of conditions, star clusters may dissolve quickly or be very long lived. The dynamical evolution of star clusters is a topic of very active research in astrophysics. Some popular models of star clusters are the so-called direct N-body simulations [1, 2], where every star is represented by a point particle that interacts gravitationally with every other particle. This kind of simulation is computationally expensive, as it scales as O(N^2) where N is the number of particles in the simulated cluster. In the following, the words ""particle"" and ""star"" are used interchangeably.
Content
This dataset contains the positions and velocities of simulated stars (particles) in a direct N-body simulation of a star cluster. In the cluster there are initially 64000 stars distributed in position-velocity space according to a King model [3]. Each .csv file named c_xxxx.csv corresponds to a snapshot of the simulation at time t = xxxx. For example, c_0000.csv contains the initial conditions (positions and velocities of stars at time t=0). Times are measured in standard N-body units [4]. This is a system of units where G = M = ‚àí4E = 1 (G is the gravitational constant, M the total mass of the cluster, and E its total energy).
x, y, z Columns 1, 2, and 3 of each file are the x, y, z positions of the stars. They are also expressed in standard N-body units [4]. You can switch to units of the median radius of the cluster by finding the cluster center and calculating the median distance of stars from it, and then dividing x, y, and z by this number. In general, the median radius changes in time. The initial conditions are approximately spherically symmetric (you can check) so there is no particular physical meaning attached to the choice of x, y, and z.
vx, vy, vz Columns 4, 5, and 6 contain the x, y, and z velocity, also in N-body units. A scale velocity for the stars can be obtained by taking the standard deviation of velocity along one direction (e.g. z). You may check that the ratio between the typical radius (see above) and the typical velocity is of order unity.
m Column 7 is the mass of each star. For this simulation this is identically 1.5625e-05, i.e. 1/64000. The total mass of the cluster is initially 1. More realistic simulations (coming soon) have a spectrum of different masses and live stelar evolution, that results in changes in the mass of stars. This simulation is a pure N-body problem instead.
Star id number The id numbers of each particle are listed in the last column (8) of the files under the header ""id"". The ids are unique and can be used to trace the position and velocity of a star across all files. There are initially 64000 particles. At end of the simulation there are 63970. This is because some particles escape the cluster.
Acknowledgements
This simulation was run on a Center for Galaxy Evolution Research (CGER) workstation at Yonsei University (Seoul, Korea), using the NBODY6 software (https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~sverre/web/pages/nbody.htm).
Inspiration
Some stars hover around the center of the cluster, while some other get kicked out to the cluster outskirts or even leave the cluster altogether. Can we predict where a star will be at any given time based on its initial position and velocity? Can we predict its velocity?
How correlated are the motions of stars? Can we predict the velocity of a given star based on the velocity of its neighbours?
The size of the cluster can be measured by defining a center (see below) and finding the median distance of stars from it. This is called the three-dimensional effective radius. Can we predict how it evolves over time? What are its properties as a time series? What can we say about other quantiles of the radius?
How to define the cluster center? Just as the mode of a KDE of the distribution of stars? How does it move over time and how to quantify the properties of its fluctuations? Is the cluster symmetric around this center?
Some stars leave the cluster: over time they exchange energy in close encounters with other stars and reach the escape velocity. This can be seen by comparing later snapshots with the initial one: some IDs are missing and there is overall a lower number of stars. Can we predict which stars are more likely to escape? When will a given star escape?

Pakistan Drone Attacks (2004-2016)
The United States has targeted militants in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas [FATA] and the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa [KPK] in Pakistan via its Predator and Reaper drone strikes since year 2004. Pakistan Body Count (www.PakistanBodyCount.org) is the oldest and most accurate running tally of drone strikes in Pakistan. The given database (PakistanDroneAttacks.CSV) has been populated by using majority of the data from Pakistan Body Count, and building up on it by canvassing open source newspapers, media reports, think tank analyses, and personal contacts in media and law enforcement agencies. We provide a count of the people killed and injured in drone strikes, including the ones who died later in hospitals or homes due to injuries caused or aggravated by drone strikes, making it the most authentic source for drone related data in this region.
We will keep releasing the updates every quarter at this page.

The World of Warcraft Avatar History Dataset is a collection of records that detail information about player characters in the game over time. It includes information about their character level, race, class, location, and social guild. The Kaggle version of this dataset includes only the information from 2008 (and the dataset in general only includes information from the 'Horde' faction of players in the game from a single game server).

Ideas for Using the Dataset
From the perspective of game system designers, players' behavior is one of the most important factors they must consider when designing game systems. To gain a fundamental understanding of the game play behavior of online gamers, exploring users' game play time provides a good starting point. This is because the concept of game play time is applicable to all genres of games and it enables us to model the system workload as well as the impact of system and network QoS on users' behavior. It can even help us predict players' loyalty to specific games.
Open Questions
Understand user gameplay behavior (game sessions, movement, leveling)
Understand user interactions (guilds)
Predict players unsubscribing from the game based on activity
What are the most popular zones in WoW, what level players tend to inhabit each?
Wrath of the Lich King
An expansion to World of Warcraft, ""Wrath of the Lich King"" (Wotlk) was released on November 13, 2008. It introduced new zones for players to go to, a new character class (the death knight), and a new level cap of 80 (up from 70 previously). This event intersects nicely with the dataset and is probably interesting to investigate.
Map
This dataset doesn't include a shapefile (if you know of one that exists, let me know!) to show where the zones the dataset talks about are. Here is a list of zones an information from this version of the game, including their recommended levels: http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Zones_by_level_(original) .
Update (Version 3): dmi3kno has generously put together some supplementary zone information files which have now been included in this dataset. Some notes about the files:
Note that some zone names contain Chinese characters. Unicode names are preserved as a key to the original dataset. What this addition will allow is to understand properties of the zones a bit better - their relative location to each other, competititive properties, type of gameplay and, hopefully, their contribution to character leveling. Location coordinates contain some redundant (and possibly duplicate) records as they are collected from different sources. Working with uncleaned location coordinate data will allow users to demonstrate their data wrangling skills (both working with strings and spatial data)."

Pitchfork is a music-centric online magazine. It was started in 1995 and grew out of independent music reviewing into a general publication format, but is still famed for its variety music reviews. I scraped over 18,000 Pitchfork reviews (going back to January 1999). Initially, this was done to satisfy a few of my own curiosities, but I bet Kagglers can come up with some really interesting analyses!

The Challenge - One challenge of modeling retail data is the need to make decisions based on limited history. Holidays and select major events come once a year, and so does the chance to see how strategic decisions impacted the bottom line. In addition, markdowns are known to affect sales ‚Äì the challenge is to predict which departments will be affected and to what extent.
Content
You are provided with historical sales data for 45 stores located in different regions - each store contains a number of departments. The company also runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of which are the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The weeks including these holidays are weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks.
Within the Excel Sheet, there are 3 Tabs ‚Äì Stores, Features and Sales
Stores
Anonymized information about the 45 stores, indicating the type and size of store
Features

Context
Natural language remains the densest encoding of human experience we have, and innovation in NLP has accelerated to power understanding of that data, but the datasets driving this innovation don't match the real language in use today. The Customer Support on Twitter dataset offers a large corpus of modern English (mostly) conversations between consumers and customer support agents on Twitter, and has three important advantages over other conversational text datasets:
Focused - Consumers contact customer support to have a specific problem solved, and the manifold of problems to be discussed is relatively small, especially compared to unconstrained conversational datasets like the reddit Corpus.
Natural - Consumers in this dataset come from a much broader segment than those in the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus and have much more natural and recent use of typed text than the Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus.
Succinct - Twitter's brevity causes more natural responses from support agents (rather than scripted), and to-the-point descriptions of problems and solutions. Also, its convenient in allowing for a relatively low message limit size for recurrent nets.
Inspiration
The size and breadth of this dataset inspires many interesting questions:
Can we predict company responses? Given the bounded set of subjects handled by each company, the answer seems like yes!
Do requests get stale? How quickly do the best companies respond, compared to the worst?
Can we learn high quality dense embeddings or representations of similarity for topical clustering?
How does tone affect the customer support conversation? Does saying sorry help?
Can we help companies identify new problems, or ones most affecting their customers?
Content
The dataset is a CSV, where each row is a tweet. The different columns are described below. Every conversation included has at least one request from a consumer and at least one response from a company. Which user IDs are company user IDs can be calculated using the inbound field.

author_id
A unique, anonymized user ID. @s in the dataset have been replaced with their associated anonymized user ID.
inbound
Whether the tweet is ""inbound"" to a company doing customer support on Twitter. This feature is useful when re-organizing data for training conversational models.

For the past few months I have been searching for a reliable source for historical price information related to cryptocurrencies. I wasn't able to find anything that I could use to my liking, so I built my own data set.
I've written a small script that scrapes historical price information for the top 200 coins by market cap as listed on CoinMarketCap.com.
I plan to run some basic analysis on it to answer questions that I have a ""gut"" feeling about, but no quantitative evidence (yet!).
Questions such as:
What is the correlation between bitcoin and alt coin prices?
What is the average age of the top 10 coins by market cap?
What day of the week is best to buy/sell?
Which coins in the top two hundred are less than 6 months old?
Which currencies are the most volatile?
What the hell happens when we go to bed and Asia starts trading?

Drosophila Melanogaster, the common fruit fly, is a model organism which has been extensively used in entymological research. It is one of the most studied organisms in biological research, particularly in genetics and developmental biology.
When its not being used for scientific research, D. melanogaster is a common pest in homes, restaurants, and anywhere else that serves food. They are not to be confused with Tephritidae flys (also known as fruit flys).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila_melanogaster
About the Genome
This genome was first sequenced in 2000. It contains four pairs of chromosomes (2,3,4 and X/Y). More than 60% of the genome appears to be functional non-protein-coding DNA.
The genome is maintained and frequently updated at FlyBase. This dataset is sourced from the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics download page. It uses the August 2014 version of the D. melanogaster genome (dm6, BDGP Release 6 + ISO1 MT). http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#fruitfly
Files were modified by Kaggle to be a better fit for analysis on Scripts. This primarily involved turning files into CSV format, with a header row, as well as converting the genome itself from 2bit format into a FASTA sequence file.
Bioinformatics
Genomic analysis can be daunting to data scientists who haven't had much experience with bioinformatics before. We have tried to give basic explanations to each of the files in this dataset, as well as links to further reading on the biological basis for each. If you haven't had the chance to study much biology before, some light reading (ie wikipedia) on the following topics may be helpful to understand the nuances of the data provided here: Genetics, Genomics (Sequencing/Genome Assembly), Chromosomes, DNA, RNA (mRNA/miRNA), Genes, Alleles, Exons, Introns, Transcription, Translation, Peptides, Proteins, Gene Regulation, Mutation, Phylogenetics, and SNPs.
Of course, if you've got some idea of the basics already - don't be afraid to jump right in!
Learning Bioinformatics
There are a lot of great resources for learning bioinformatics on the web. One cool site is Rosalind - a platform that gives you bioinformatic coding challenges to complete. You can use Kaggle Scripts on this dataset to easily complete the challenges on Rosalind (and see Myles' solutions here if you get stuck). We have set up Biopython on Kaggle's docker image which is a great library to help you with your analyses. Check out their tutorial here and we've also created a python notebook with some of the tutorial applied to this dataset as a reference.
Files in this Dataset

The assembled genome itself is presented here in FASTA format. Each chromosome is a different sequence of nucleotides. Repeats from RepeatMasker and Tandem Repeats Finder (with period of 12 or less) are show in lower case; non-repeating sequence is shown in upper case.
Meta Information
There are 3 additional files with meta information about the genome.
meta-cpg-island-ext-unmasked.csv
This file contains descriptive information about CpG Islands in the genome.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_site
meta-cytoband.csv
This file describes the positions of cytogenic bands on each chromosome.

meta-simple-repeat.csv
This file describes simple tandem repeats in the genome.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_sequence_(DNA) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandem_repeat
Drosophila Melanogaster mRNA Sequences
Messenger RNA (mRNA) is an intermediate molecule created as part of the cellular process of converting genomic information into proteins. Some mRNA are never translated into proteins and have functional roles in the cell on their own. Collectively, organism mRNA information is known as a Transcriptome. mRNA files included in this dataset give insight into the activity of genes in the organism.

mrna-refseq.fa
This file includes all mRNA sequences from RefSeq associated with Drosophila Melanogaster.

Gene Predictions
A gene is a segment of DNA on the genome which, through mRNA, is used to create proteins in the organism. Knowing which parts of DNA are coding (genes) or non-coding is difficult, and a number of different systems for prediction exist. This dataset includes a number of different gene prediction systems applied to the drosophila melanogaster genome.

ensembl-to-gene-name.csv
Ensembl provides gene annotation generated by their software Genebuild. This process combines automatic annotation alongside manual curation. http://uswest.ensembl.org/info/genome/genebuild/genome_annotation.html
We have also included some supplementary files for these, including predicted protein peptide sequences for each predicted gene.
genes-refseq.csv
genes-xeno-refseq.csv
refseq-link.csv
refseq-summary.csv
We have included two RefSeq gene predictions in this dataset. The first is based solely on information from the drosophila melanogaster genome. The second (genes-xeno-refseq.csv) uses genes from other organisms as a basis for predicting genes in drosophila melanogaster.
RefSeq RNAs were aligned against the D. melanogaster genome using blat; those with an alignment of less than 15% were discarded. When a single RNA aligned in multiple places, the alignment having the highest base identity was identified. Only alignments having a base identity level within 0.1% of the best and at least 96% base identity with the genomic sequence were kept.
We have also included supplementary files for these which include information about the genes that have been identified.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/
What can you do with this data?
Genomic data is the foundation of bioinformatics, and there is an incredible array of things you can do with this data. A good place to start is to look at some of the meta supplementary files alongside the genomic sequence itself.
We have a number of different gene prediction systems in the dataset, how do they compare to each other? How do they compare to the mRNA data?
Working back from the refseq-summary.csv file, you can look at genes that code for particular proteins - can you find these genes in the genome?
How much of the genome codes for the mRNA's found in our mRNA data? Of the mRNA's we have, how many map to the predicted genes and the predicted peptided sequence data? How much of the mRNA seems to be protein-coding vs how much looks like it is miRNA? Can you find pre-mRNA or splice variants within the mRNA data? Does meta information like cytogenic bands or CpG sites correspond with splice variants or a lack of mRNA altogether?
Those are just some of many ideas that could get you started.
Looking for Feedback
This is the first genomic dataset on Kaggle and we are looking for feedback from our community about how interesting this dataset is to them, or if there are ways we could improve it to better suit analysis. Please post suggestions for supplementary data, future genomes we could host, bioinformatics packages we should include on scripts, and any other feedback on the dataset forum."

I wanted to see how articles clustered together if the articles were rendered into document-term matrices---would there be greater affinity among political affiliations, or medium, subject matter, etc. The data was scraped using BeautifulSoup and stored in Sqlite, but I've chopped it up into three separate CSVs here, because the entire Sqlite database came out to about 1.2 gb, beyond Kaggle's max.
Content
Each row contains:
an id for the Sqlite database
author name
full date
month
year
title
publication name
article url (not available for all articles)
full article content
The publications include the New York Times, Breitbart, CNN, Business Insider, the Atlantic, Fox News, Talking Points Memo, Buzzfeed News, National Review, New York Post, the Guardian, NPR, Reuters, Vox, and the Washington Post. Sampling wasn't quite scientific; I chose publications based on my familiarity of the domain and tried to get a range of political alignments, as well as a mix of print and digital publications. By count, the publications break down accordingly:
It's not entirely even---this was something of a collect-it-all approach, and some sites are more prolific than others, and some have data that maintains integrity after scraping more easily than others.
For each publication, I used archive.org to grab the past year-and-a-half of either home-page headlines or RSS feeds and ran those links through the scraper. That is, the articles are not the product of scraping an entire site, but rather their more prominently placed articles. For example, CNN's articles from 5/6/16 were what appeared on the homepage of CNN.com proper, not everything within the CNN.com domain. Vox's articles from 5/6/16 were everything that appeared in the Vox RSS reader. on 5/6/16, and so on. RSS readers are a breeze to scrape, and so I used them when possible, but not every publication uses them or makes them easy to find.
The data primarily falls between the years of 2016 and July 2017, although there is a not-insignificant number of articles from 2015, and a possibly insignificant number from before then.
A note: there are some stray spaces between non-word characters at times as well as some other minor blemishes and imperfections here and there, the result of cleaning a very messy dataset.

To quickly get started creating maps, like the one below, see the Quick Start R kernel.
How the Dataset was Created
This Dataset was created from the Excel Spreadsheet, which can be found in the download. Or, you can view the source here. If you take a look at the row for United States, for the column Mortality Rate, 1980*, you'll see the set of numbers 1.52 (1.44, 1.61). Numbers in parentheses are 95% uncertainty. The 1.52 is an age-standardized mortality rate for both sexes combined (deaths per 100,000 population).
In this Dataset 1.44 will be placed in the named column Mortality Rage, 1989 (Min)* and 1.61 is in column named Mortality Rate, 1980 (Max)* . For information on how these Age-standardized mortality rates were calculated, see the December JAMA 2016 article, which you can download for free.

Context
India - Annual Health Survey(AHS) 2012-13:
The survey was conducted in Empowered Action Group (EAG) states Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh & Madhya Pradesh and Assam. These nine states, which account for about 48 percent of the total population, 59 percent of Births, 70 percent of Infant Deaths, 75 percent of Under 5 Deaths and 62 percent of Maternal Deaths in the country, are the high focus States in view of their relatively higher fertility and mortality.
A representative sample of about 21 million population and 4.32 million households were covered 20k+ sample units which is spread across rural and urban area of these 9 states.
The objective of the AHS is to yield a comprehensive, representative and reliable dataset on core vital indicators including composite ones like Infant Mortality Rate, Maternal Mortality Ratio and Total Fertility Rate along with their co-variates (process and outcome indicators) at the district level and map the changes therein on an annual basis. These benchmarks would help in better and holistic understanding and timely monitoring of various determinants on well-being and health of population particularly Reproductive and Child Health.

The data encompasses information for all working American citizens as of January 2015. The incomes are broken into male and female statistics, preceded by the total median income when including both genders.

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The survey is unique in that it combines interviews and physical examinations. NHANES is a major program of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). NCHS is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and has the responsibility for producing vital and health statistics for the Nation.
The NHANES program began in the early 1960s and has been conducted as a series of surveys focusing on different population groups or health topics. In 1999, the survey became a continuous program that has a changing focus on a variety of health and nutrition measurements to meet emerging needs. The survey examines a nationally representative sample of about 5,000 persons each year. These persons are located in counties across the country, 15 of which are visited each year.
The NHANES interview includes demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health-related questions. The examination component consists of medical, dental, and physiological measurements, as well as laboratory tests administered by highly trained medical personnel.
To date, thousands of research findings have been published using the NHANES data.

This dataset contains the 1070 selected predictions of all Kaggle participants. These predictions were collected and locked in prior to the start of the tournament.
How can this data be used? You can pivot it to look at both Kaggle and NCAA teams alike. You can look at who will win games, which games will be close, which games are hardest to forecast, or which Kaggle teams are gambling vs. sticking to the data.
The NCAA tournament is a single-elimination tournament that begins with 68 teams. There are four games, usually called the ‚Äúplay-in round,‚Äù before the traditional bracket action starts. Due to competition timing, these games are included in the prediction files but should not be used in analysis, as it‚Äôs possible that the prediction was submitted after the play-in round games were over.
Data Description
Each Kaggle team could submit up to two prediction files. The prediction files in the dataset are in the 'predictions' folder and named according to:
TeamName_TeamId_SubmissionId.csv
The file format contains a probability prediction for every possible game between the 68 teams. This is necessary to cover every possible tournament outcome. Each team has a unique numerical Id (given in Teams.csv). Each game has a unique Id column created by concatenating the year and the two team Ids. The format is the following:
Id,Pred
2016_1112_1114,0.6
2016_1112_1122,0
...
The team with the lower numerical Id is always listed first. ‚ÄúPred‚Äù represents the probability that the team with the lower Id beats the team with the higher Id. For example, ""2016_1112_1114,0.6"" indicates team 1112 has a 0.6 probability of beating team 1114.
For convenience, we have included the data files from the 2016 March Mania competition dataset in the Scripts environment (you may find TourneySlots.csv and TourneySeeds.csv useful for determining matchups, see the documentation). However, the focus of this dataset is on Kagglers' predictions."

EEG devices are becoming cheaper and more inconspicuous, but few applications leverage EEG data effectively, in part because there are few large repositories of EEG data. The MIDS class at the UC Berkeley School of Information is sharing a dataset collected using consumer-grade brainwave-sensing headsets, along with the software code and visual stimulus used to collect the data. The dataset includes all subjects' readings during the stimulus presentation, as well as readings from before the start and after the end of the stimulus.
Content
We presented two slightly different stimuli to two different groups. Stimuli 1 is available here, and stimuli 2 is available here.
For both stimuli, a group of about 15 people saw the stimuli at the same time, while EEG data was being collected. The stimuli each person saw is available in the session field of subject-metadata.csv. (Subjects who saw stimulus 2 left the room during stimulus 1, and vice versa).
Find the synchronized times for both stimuli in stimulus-timing.csv.
For each participant, we also anonymously collected some other metadata: (1) whether or not they had previously seen the video displayed during the stimulus (a superbowl ad), (2) gender, (3) whether or not they saw hidden icons displayed during the color counting exercise, and (4) their chosen color during the color counting exercise. All of these can be found in subject-metadata.csv.
We also collected the timing (in indra_time) of all stimulus events for both session 1 and session 2. These times are included in stimulus-times.csv.
The server receives one data packet every second from each Mindwave Mobile device, and stores the data in one row entry.

The data is a preprocessed subset of the TCIA Study named Soft Tissue Sarcoma. The data have been converted from DICOM folders of varying resolution and data types to 3D HDF5 arrays with isotropic voxel size. This should make it easier to get started and test out various approaches (NN, RF, CRF, etc) to improve segmentations.
TCIA Summary
This collection contains FDG-PET/CT and anatomical MR (T1-weighted, T2-weighted with fat-suppression) imaging data from 51 patients with histologically proven soft-tissue sarcomas (STSs) of the extremities. All patients had pre-treatment FDG-PET/CT and MRI scans between November 2004 and November 2011. (Note: date in the TCIA images have been changed in the interest of de-identification; the same change was applied across all images, preserving the time intervals between serial scans). During the follow-up period, 19 patients developed lung metastases. Imaging data and lung metastases development status were used in the following study:

Zillow operates an industry-leading economics and analytics bureau led by Zillow‚Äôs Chief Economist, Dr. Stan Humphries. At Zillow, Dr. Humphries and his team of economists and data analysts produce extensive housing data and analysis covering more than 500 markets nationwide. Zillow Research produces various real estate, rental and mortgage-related metrics and publishes unique analyses on current topics and trends affecting the housing market.
At Zillow‚Äôs core is our living database of more than 100 million U.S. homes, featuring both public and user-generated information including number of bedrooms and bathrooms, tax assessments, home sales and listing data of homes for sale and for rent. This data allows us to calculate, among other indicators, the Zestimate, a highly accurate, automated, estimated value of almost every home in the country as well as the Zillow Home Value Index and Zillow Rent Index, leading measures of median home values and rents.
Content
The Zillow Rent Index is the median estimated monthly rental price for a given area, and covers multifamily, single family, condominium, and cooperative homes in Zillow‚Äôs database, regardless of whether they are currently listed for rent. It is expressed in dollars and is seasonally adjusted. The Zillow Rent Index is published at the national, state, metro, county, city, neighborhood, and zip code levels.
Zillow produces rent estimates (Rent Zestimates) based on proprietary statistical and machine learning models. Within each county or state, the models observe recent rental listings and learn the relative contribution of various home attributes in predicting prevailing rents. These home attributes include physical facts about the home, prior sale transactions, tax assessment information and geographic location as well as the estimated market value of the home (Zestimate). Based on the patterns learned, these models estimate rental prices on all homes, including those not presently for rent. Because of the availability of Zillow rental listing data used to train the models, Rent Zestimates are only available back to November 2010; therefore, each ZRI time series starts on the same date.
Acknowledgements
The rent index data was calculated from Zillow's proprietary Rent Zestimates and published on its website.

A recent Guardian blog post asks: ""How many endangered languages are there in the World and what are the chances they will die out completely?"" The United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) regularly publishes a list of endangered languages, using a classification system that describes its danger (or completion) of extinction.
Content
The full detailed dataset includes names of languages, number of speakers, the names of countries where the language is still spoken, and the degree of endangerment. The UNESCO endangerment classification is as follows:
Vulnerable: most children speak the language, but it may be restricted to certain domains (e.g., home)
Definitely endangered: children no longer learn the language as a 'mother tongue' in the home
Severely endangered: language is spoken by grandparents and older generations; while the parent generation may understand it, they do not speak it to children or among themselves
Critically endangered: the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently
Extinct: there are no speakers left

The Mobile phone activity dataset is composed by one week of Call Details Records (CDRs) from the city of Milan and the Province of Trentino (Italy).
Description of the dataset
Every time a user engages a telecommunication interaction, a Radio Base Station (RBS) is assigned by the operator and delivers the communication through the network. Then, a new CDR is created recording the time of the interaction and the RBS which handled it. The following activities are present in the dataset:
received SMS
sent SMS
incoming calls
outgoing calls
Internet activity
In particular, Internet activity is generated each time a user starts an Internet connection or ends an Internet connection. Moreover, during the same connection a CDR is generated if the connection lasts for more than 15‚Äâmin or the user transferred more than 5‚ÄâMB.
The datasets is spatially aggregated in a square cells grid. The area of Milan is composed of a grid overlay of 1,000 (squares with size of about 235√ó235‚Äâmeters. This grid is projected with the WGS84 (EPSG:4326) standard. For more details we link the original paper http://go.nature.com/2fcOX5E
The data provides CellID, CountryCode and all the aforementioned telecommunication activities aggregated every 60 minutes.
Original datasource
The Mobile phone activity dataset is a part of the Telecom Italia Big Data Challenge 2014, which is a rich and open multi-source aggregation of telecommunications, weather, news, social networks and electricity data from the city of Milan and the Province of Trentino (Italy). The original dataset has been created by Telecom Italia in association with EIT ICT Labs, SpazioDati, MIT Media Lab, Northeastern University, Polytechnic University of Milan, Fondazione Bruno Kessler, University of Trento and Trento RISE. In order to make it easy-to-use, here we provide a subset of telecommunications data that allows researchers to design algorithms able to exploit an enormous number of behavioral and social indicators. The complete version of the dataset is available at the following link: http://go.nature.com/2fz4AFr
Relevant, external, data sources
The presented datasets can be enriched by using census data provided by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) (http://www.istat.it/en/), a public research organization and the main provider of official statistics in Italy. The census data have been released for 1999, 2001 and 2011. The dataset (http://www.istat.it/it/archivio/104317), released in Italian, is composed of four parts: Territorial Bases (Basi Territoriali), Administrative Boundaries (Confini Amministrativi), Census Variables (Variabili Censuarie) and data about Toponymy (Dati Toponomastici).

How it began
One fine day, when someone with the idea of self sufficient AI capable of writing it's own poems wanted data, he stumbled upon the idea of using songs as a source. The journey wasn't easy, since each song has it's own page with the lyrics and scraping pages one at a time (when there are over a million of them) is a slow task. I worked up some optimisations here and there. For people interested in going through the process:
GITHUB PROJECT.
Content
There is a lot to play with here, though all of it vertically. There isn't a lot of variation in the types of fields until you look deep enough.
The main dataset is split up into 2 files, each containing ~250,000 songs with their artists and lyrics. The files are titled Lyrics1 and Lyrics2. The fields include band name, song name and lyrics.
Go through the exploration scripts for how to use the lyrics data set and other interesting observations.
Another file containing urls of description pages of different artists is also provided, titled ArtistUrls.

After seeing the response for the FIFA PLAYER DATASET it was exciting as ever to get this one off.
Soon it was realised, not a lot of places exist where extracting data is straightforward.
Then one stumbles upon the perfectly indexed page : https://www.lyrics.com/. They deserve major credit for the existence of this dataset.
Inspiration
This started off as a source for some kind of intelligent poet which writes poems on it's own. It would be great to see what the artificially intelligent world has to express once it knows enough, and beautifully if at all?"

The entire dataset has been created (and actualized) by INSEE, I just uploaded it on Kaggle after doing some jobs and checks on it. I haven't seen INSEE on Kaggle yet but I think it would be great to bring the organization in as a Kaggle actor.
Inspiration
First aim I had creating that dataset was to provide a map of french towns with the number of firm that are settled in by size.
Now my goal is to explore inequality between men and women, youngsters and elders, working / social classes.
Population can also be a great filter to explain some phenomenons on the maps."

Zeeshan-ul-hassan Usmani‚Äôs Genome Phenotype SNPs Raw Data
Genomics is a branch of molecular biology that involves structure, function, variation, evolution and mapping of genomes. There are several companies offering next generation sequencing of human genomes from complete 3 billion base-pairs to a few thousand Phenotype SNPs. I‚Äôve used 23andMe (using Illumina HumanOmniExpress-24) for my DNA‚Äôs Phenotype SNPs. I am sharing the entire raw dataset here for the international research community for following reasons:
I am a firm believer in open dataset, transparency, and the right to learn, research, explores, and educate. I do not want to restrict the knowledge flow for mere privacy concerns. Hence, I am offering my entire DNA raw data for the world to use for research without worrying about privacy. I call it copyleft dataset.
Most of available test datasets for research come from western world and we don‚Äôt see much from under-developing countries. I thought to share my data to bridge the gap and I expect others to follow the trend.
I would be the happiest man on earth, if a life can be saved, knowledge can be learned, an idea can be explore, or a fact can be found using my DNA data. Please use it the way you will

The data set consists of three different types of data:
Census and Geographic Data;
Energy Data; and

When creating the data set, I combined data from many different types of sources, all of which are cited below. I have also provided the fields included in the data set and what they represent below. I have not performed any research on the data yet, but am going to dive in soon. I am particularly interested in the relationships between various types of data (i.e. GDP or birth rate) in prediction algorithms. Given that I have compiled 5 years‚Äô worth of data, this data set was primarily constructed with predictive algorithms in mind.
An additional note before you delve into the fields: * There could have been many more variables added across many different fields of metrics. I have stopped here, but it could potentially be beneficial to observe the interaction of these variables with others (i.e. the GDP of certain industries, the average age in a state, the male/female gender ratio, etc.) to attempt to find additional trends.

As noted from the census:
Net international migration for the United States includes the international migration of both native and foreign-born populations. Specifically, it includes: (a) the net international migration of the foreign born, (b) the net migration between the United States and Puerto Rico, (c) the net migration of natives to and from the United States, and (d) the net movement of the Armed Forces population between the United States and overseas. Net international migration for Puerto Rico includes the migration of native and foreign-born populations between the United States and Puerto Rico.

Figure out which features are actually important, which are redundant, and what features could be added to make the predictions more accurate.
Data
The dataset consists of 26,000 people counts (about every 10 minutes) over the last year. In addition, I gathered extra info including weather and semester-specific information that might affect how crowded it is. The label is the number of people, which I'd like to predict given some subset of the features.

The aim of this dataset is to provide a simple way to get started with 3D computer vision problems such as 3D shape recognition.
Accurate 3D point clouds can (easily and cheaply) be adquired nowdays from different sources:
RGB-D devices: Google Tango, Microsoft Kinect, etc.
Lidar.
3D reconstruction from multiple images.
However there is a lack of large 3D datasets (you can find a good one here based on triangular meshes); it's especially hard to find datasets based on point clouds (wich is the raw output from every 3D sensing device).
This dataset contains 3D point clouds generated from the original images of the MNIST dataset to bring a familiar introduction to 3D to people used to work with 2D datasets (images).
In the 3D_from_2D notebook you can find the code used to generate the dataset.
You can use the code in the notebook to generate a bigger 3D dataset from the original.
Content
full_dataset_vectors.h5
The entire dataset stored as 4096-D vectors obtained from the voxelization (x:16, y:16, z:16) of all the 3D point clouds.
In adition to the original point clouds, it contains randomly rotated copies with noise.
The full dataset is splitted into arrays:
X_train (10000, 4096)
y_train (10000)
X_test(2000, 4096)
y_test (2000)
Example python code reading the full dataset:
 with h5py.File(""../input/train_point_clouds.h5"", ""r"") as hf:    
     X_train = hf[""X_train""][:]
     y_train = hf[""y_train""][:]    
     X_test = hf[""X_test""][:]  
     y_test = hf[""y_test""][:]  
train_point_clouds.h5 & test_point_clouds.h5
5000 (train), and 1000 (test) 3D point clouds stored in HDF5 file format. The point clouds have zero mean and a maximum dimension range of 1.
Each file is divided into HDF5 groups
Each group is named as its corresponding array index in the original mnist dataset and it contains:
""points"" dataset: x, y, z coordinates of each 3D point in the point cloud.
""normals"" dataset: nx, ny, nz components of the unit normal associate to each point.
""img"" dataset: the original mnist image.
""label"" attribute: the original mnist label.
Example python code reading 2 digits and storing some of the group content in tuples:
with h5py.File(""../input/train_point_clouds.h5"", ""r"") as hf:    
    a = hf[""0""]
    b = hf[""1""]    
    digit_a = (a[""img""][:], a[""points""][:], a.attrs[""label""]) 
    digit_b = (b[""img""][:], b[""points""][:], b.attrs[""label""]) 
voxelgrid.py
Simple Python class that generates a grid of voxels from the 3D point cloud. Check kernel for use.
plot3D.py
Module with functions to plot point clouds and voxelgrid inside jupyter notebook. You have to run this locally due to Kaggle's notebook lack of support to rendering Iframes. See github issue here
Functions included:

CRIME STATISTICS: INTEGRITY
The South African Police Service (SAPS) has accepted a new and challeging objective of ensuring that its crime statistics are in line with international best practice. This will be achieved through a Memorandum of Understanding with Statistics South Africa (Stats SA), aimed at further enhancing the quality and integrity of the South African crime statistics.
The crime statistics generated by SAPS are an important link in the value chain of the statistics system informs policy development and planning in the criminal justice system. The collaboration with StatsSA will go a long way in enhancing the integrity of the SAPS crime statistics and ensuring that policy-makers have quality data to assist them with making policy decisions.

Video games are a rich area for data extraction due to their digital nature. Notable examples such as the complex EVE Online economy, World of Warcraft corrupted blood incident and even Grand Theft Auto self-driving cars tells us that fiction is closer to reality than we really think. Data scientists can gain insight on the logic and decision-making that the players face when put in hypothetical and virtual scenarios.
In this Kaggle Dataset, I provide just over 1400 competitive matchmaking matches from Valve's game Counter-strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO). The data was extracted from competitive matchmaking replays submitted to csgo-stats. I intend for this data-set to be purely exploratory, however users are free to create their own predictive models they see fit.
About Counter-Strike: Global Offensive
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a first-person shooter game pitting two teams of 5 players against each other. Within a maximum of 30 rounds, the two teams find themselves on either side as a Counter Terrorist or Terrorist. Both sides are tasked with eliminating the opposition or, as the terrorist team, planting the C4 bomb at a bomb site and allowing it to explode. Rounds are played out until either of those two objectives or if the maximum time is reached (in which the counter terrorists then win by default). At the end of the 15th round, the two teams switch sides and continue until one team reaches 16 round wins first. CS:GO is widely known for its competitive aspect of technical skill, teamwork and in-game strategies. Players are constantly rewarded with the efforts they put it in training and learning through advancing in rank.
Click here to read more about the competitive mechanics of CS:GO.
Content
This dataset within the 1400 matches provides every successful entry of duels (or battle) that took place for a player. That is, each row documents an event when a player is hurt by another player (or World e.g fall damage). There are over 900,000 entries within more than 31500 rounds.
mm_master_demos.csv contains information on rounds fired, while mm_grenades_demos.csv contains information on grenades thrown. The fields in the two datasets are similar: highlights include shooters and victims, event coordinates, and timestamps. The datasets also includes static information on the match winner, player ranks before and after the match, and other miscellaneous match-level metadata.
For further information on individual fields in the dataset, refer to the Column Metadata.
Interpreting Positional Data
This dataset also includes a selection of the game's official radar maps, as well as a table, map_data.csv, to aid in mapping data over them. The X,Y coordinates included in the dataset are all in in-game coordinates and need to be linearly scaled to be plotted on any official radar maps. See converting to map coordinates for more information.

This dataset expands on my earlier New York City Census Data dataset. It includes data from the entire country instead of just New York City. The expanded data will allow for much more interesting analyses and will also be much more useful at supporting other data sets.
Content
The data here are taken from the DP03 and DP05 tables of the 2015 American Community Survey 5-year estimates. The full datasets and much more can be found at the American Factfinder website. Currently, I include two data files:
acs2015_census_tract_data.csv: Data for each census tract in the US, including DC and Puerto Rico.
acs2015_county_data.csv: Data for each county or county equivalent in the US, including DC and Puerto Rico.
The two files have the same structure, with just a small difference in the name of the id column. Counties are political subdivisions, and the boundaries of some have been set for centuries. Census tracts, however, are defined by the census bureau and will have a much more consistent size. A typical census tract has around 5000 or so residents.
The Census Bureau updates the estimates approximately every year. At least some of the 2016 data is already available, so I will likely update this in the near future.

There are many questions that we could try to answer with the data here. Can we predict things such as the state (classification) or household income (regression)? What kinds of clusters can we find in the data? What other datasets can be improved by the addition of census data?"

Generally, a preliminary report is available online within a few days of an accident. Factual information is added when available, and when the investigation is completed, the preliminary report is replaced with a final description of the accident and its probable cause. Full narrative descriptions may not be available for dates before 1993, cases under revision, or where NTSB did not have primary investigative responsibility.

paper --> https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00888
At ASONAM2017, PydataDubai vol 1.0 @ AWOK, PyDataBCN2017 @ EASDE we have presented the paper Happiness inside a job?... Many people in the various audiences asked why we avoid using emojis to predict and profile employees. The answer is that we prefer to use links of likes because they are more authentic than words or emojis. In the same way that google page rank is more effective when it looks at links between pages rather than content inside the pages. ... Still people keep asking about it. But there is one thing emoji are good at estimating: author sentiment and that is just possible thanks to the unique characteristics of the dataset at hand.
Previous research has traditionally analyzed emoji sentiment from the point of view of the reader of the content not the author. Here, we analyze emoji sentiment from the author point of view and present a benchmark that was built from an employee happiness dataset where emoji happen to be annotated with daily happiness of the author of the comment. We also found out that people that use emoji are happier!?, muuch happier... But the question is, what did we miss?
Content
The main table contains columns named after emoji hex codes, a 1 means the emoji appears one time in the comment (row). This dataset is an expanded version of this one, but has different formats, columns and one different table, that is why we decided to release it as separate dataset. as he scripts are not compatible.
Other stuff
The R script written on MAC OS does not work in the kaggle platform (because numbers become factors and other little changes in how the code is interpreted...), the full working script (tested on R studio MAC OS) can be found at https://github.com/orioli/emoji-writer-sentiment

HR data can be hard to come by, and HR professionals generally lag behind with respect to analytics and data visualization competency. Thus, Dr. Carla Patalano and I set out to create our own HR-related dataset, which is used in one of our graduate MSHRM courses called HR Metrics and Analytics, at New England College of Business. We created this data set ourselves.

Netflix in the past 5-10 years has captured a large populate of viewers. With more viewers, there most likely an increase of show variety. However, do people understand the distribution of ratings on Netflix shows?
Content
Because of the vast amount of time it would take to gather 1,000 shows one by one, the gathering method took advantage of the Netflix‚Äôs suggestion engine. The suggestion engine recommends shows similar to the selected show. As part of this data set, I took 4 videos from 4 ratings (totaling 16 unique shows), then pulled 53 suggested shows per video. The ratings include: G, PG, TV-14, TV-MA. I chose not to pull from every rating (e.g. TV-G, TV-Y, etc.).

Our world population is expected to grow from 7.3 billion today to 9.7 billion in the year 2050. Finding solutions for feeding the growing world population has become a hot topic for food and agriculture organizations, entrepreneurs and philanthropists. These solutions range from changing the way we grow our food to changing the way we eat. To make things harder, the world's climate is changing and it is both affecting and affected by the way we grow our food ‚Äì agriculture. This dataset provides an insight on our worldwide food production - focusing on a comparison between food produced for human consumption and feed produced for animals.

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations provides free access to food and agriculture data for over 245 countries and territories, from the year 1961 to the most recent update (depends on the dataset). One dataset from the FAO's database is the Food Balance Sheets. It presents a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country's food supply during a specified reference period, the last time an update was loaded to the FAO database was in 2013. The food balance sheet shows for each food item the sources of supply and its utilization. This chunk of the dataset is focused on two utilizations of each food item available:
Food - refers to the total amount of the food item available as human food during the reference period.
Feed - refers to the quantity of the food item available for feeding to the livestock and poultry during the reference period.
Dataset's attributes:
Area code - Country name abbreviation
Area - County name
Item - Food item
Element - Food or Feed
Latitude - geographic coordinate that specifies the north‚Äìsouth position of a point on the Earth's surface
Longitude - geographic coordinate that specifies the east-west position of a point on the Earth's surface

National Institutes of Health Chest X-Ray Dataset
Chest X-ray exams are one of the most frequent and cost-effective medical imaging examinations available. However, clinical diagnosis of a chest X-ray can be challenging and sometimes more difficult than diagnosis via chest CT imaging. The lack of large publicly available datasets with annotations means it is still very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve clinically relevant computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) in real world medical sites with chest X-rays. One major hurdle in creating large X-ray image datasets is the lack resources for labeling so many images. Prior to the release of this dataset, Openi was the largest publicly available source of chest X-ray images with 4,143 images available.
This NIH Chest X-ray Dataset is comprised of 112,120 X-ray images with disease labels from 30,805 unique patients. To create these labels, the authors used Natural Language Processing to text-mine disease classifications from the associated radiological reports. The labels are expected to be >90% accurate and suitable for weakly-supervised learning. The original radiology reports are not publicly available but you can find more details on the labeling process in this Open Access paper: ""ChestX-ray8: Hospital-scale Chest X-ray Database and Benchmarks on Weakly-Supervised Classification and Localization of Common Thorax Diseases."" (Wang et al.)

Pakistan Suicide Bombing Attacks (1995-2016)
Suicide bombing is an operational method in which the very act of the attack is dependent upon the death of the perpetrator. Though only 3% of all terrorist attacks around the world can be classified as suicide bombing attacks these account for 48% of the casualties. Explosions and suicide bombings have become the modus operandi of terrorist organizations throughout the world. The world is full of unwanted explosives, brutal bombings, accidents, and violent conflicts, and there is a need to understand the impact of these explosions on one‚Äôs surroundings, the environment, and most importantly on human bodies. From 1980 to 2001 (excluding 9/11/01) the average number of deaths per incident for suicide bombing attacks was 13. This number is far above the average of less than one death per incident across all types of terrorist attacks over the same time period. Suicide bombers, unlike any other device or means of destruction, can think and therefore detonate the charge at an optimal location with perfect timing to cause maximum carnage and destruction. Suicide bombers are adaptive and can quickly change targets if forced by security risk or the availability of better targets. Suicide attacks are relatively inexpensive to fund and technologically primitive, as IEDs can be readily constructed.
World has seen more than 3,600 suicide bombing attacks in over 40 countries since 1982. Suicide Bombing has wreaked havoc in Pakistan in the last decade or so. From only a couple of attacks before 2000, it kept escalating after the US Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, promiscuously killing hundreds of people each year, towering as one of the most prominent security threats that every single Pakistani faces today. The conundrum of suicide bombing in Pakistan has obliterated 6,982 clean-handed civilians and injured another 17,624 in a total of 475 attacks since 1995. More than 94% of these attacks have taken place after year 2006. From 2007 to 2013 the country witnessed a suicide bombing attack on every 6th day that increased to every 4th day in 2013. Counting the dead and the injured, each attack victimizes 48 people in Pakistan.
Pakistan Body Count (www.PakistanBodyCount.org) is the oldest and most accurate running tally of suicide bombings in Pakistan. The given database (PakistanSuicideAttacks.CSV) has been populated by using majority of the data from Pakistan Body Count, and building up on it by canvassing open source newspapers, media reports, think tank analyses, and personal contacts in media and law enforcement agencies. We provide a count of the people killed and injured in suicide attacks, including the ones who died later in hospitals or homes due to injuries caused or aggravated by these attacks (second and tertiary blast injuries), making it the most authentic source for suicide attacks related data in this region.
We will keep releasing the updates every quarter at this page.

Eclipses of the sun can only occur when the moon is near one of its two orbital nodes during the new moon phase. It is then possible for the Moon's penumbral, umbral, or antumbral shadows to sweep across Earth's surface thereby producing an eclipse. There are four types of solar eclipses: a partial eclipse, during which the moon's penumbral shadow traverses Earth and umbral and antumbral shadows completely miss Earth; an annular eclipse, during which the moon's antumbral shadow traverses Earth but does not completely cover the sun; a total eclipse, during which the moon's umbral shadow traverses Earth and completely covers the sun; and a hybrid eclipse, during which the moon's umbral and antumbral shadows traverse Earth and annular and total eclipses are visible in different locations. Earth will experience 11898 solar eclipses during the five millennium period -1999 to +3000 (2000 BCE to 3000 CE).
Eclipses of the moon can occur when the moon is near one of its two orbital nodes during the full moon phase. It is then possible for the moon to pass through Earth's penumbral or umbral shadows thereby producing an eclipse. There are three types of lunar eclipses: a penumbral eclipse, during which the moon traverses Earth's penumbral shadow but misses its umbral shadow; a partial eclipse, during which the moon traverses Earth's penumbral and umbral shadows; and a total eclipse, during which the moon traverses Earth's penumbral and umbral shadows and passes completely into Earth's umbra.

linguistics",CSV,9 GB,CC4,"10,298 views","1,539 downloads",7 kernels,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/google-nlu/text-normalization,"Challenge Description
This dataset and accompanying paper present a challenge to the community: given a large corpus of written text aligned to its normalized spoken form, train an RNN to learn the correct normalization function. That is, a date written ""31 May 2014"" is spoken as ""the thirty first of may twenty fourteen."" We present a dataset of general text where the normalizations were generated using an existing text normalization component of a text-to-speech (TTS) system. This dataset was originally released open-source here and is reproduced on Kaggle for the community.
The Data
The data in this directory are the English language training, development and test data used in Sproat and Jaitly (2016).
The following divisions of data were used:
Training: output_1 through output_21 (corresponding to output-000[0-8]?-of-00100 in the original dataset)
Runtime eval: output_91 (corresponding to output-0009[0-4]-of-00100 in the original dataset)
Test data: output_96 (corresponding to output-0009[5-9]-of-00100 in the original dataset)
In practice for the results reported in the paper only the first 100,002 lines of output-00099-of-00100 were used (for English).
Lines with """" in two columns are the end of sentence marker, otherwise there are three columns, the first of which is the ""semiotic class"" (Taylor, 2009), the second is the input token and the third is the output, following the paper cited above.
All text is from Wikipedia. All data were extracted on 2016/04/08, and run through the Google Kestrel TTS text normalization system (Ebden and Sproat, 2015), so that the notion of ""token"", ""semiotic class"" and reference output are all Kestrel's notion.
Our Research
In this paper, we present our own experiments with this data set with a variety of different RNN architectures. While some of the architectures do in fact produce very good results when measured in terms of overall accuracy, the errors that are produced are problematic, since they would convey completely the wrong message if such a system were deployed in a speech application. On the other hand, we show that a simple FST-based filter can mitigate those errors, and achieve a level of accuracy not achievable by the RNN alone.
Though our conclusions are largely negative on this point, we are actually not arguing that the text normalization problem is intractable using an pure RNN approach, merely that it is not going to be something that can be solved merely by having huge amounts of annotated text data and feeding that to a general RNN model. And with open-source data, we provide a novel data set for sequence-to-sequence modeling in the hopes that the the community can find better solutions.

Horse Racing - Tipster Bets,Thirty nine thousand bets from thirty one tipsters,gunner38,35,"Version 3,2016-09-14|Version 2,2016-09-14|Version 1,2016-09-13",horse racing,CSV,3 MB,Other,"16,607 views","1,060 downloads",19 kernels,4 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/gunner38/horseracing,"Horse Racing - A different and profitable approach
The traditional approach in attempting to make a profit from horse-racing, using machine learning techniques, is to use systems involving dozens and dozens of variables. These systems include the following types of variables:
Horse - Name, Sex, Age, Pedigree, Weight, Speed over various distances, race data with finishing times and positions - etc. Trainer info. Jockey info. Track info - Track, track conditions - etc.
And a whole lot more.
Finding, compiling, maintaining and updating this data is a massive task for the individual. Unless you have access to a database of such data - where would you even start?
We have a different approach.
We collect, maintain and use data from various 'Tipsters'. The tipsters use their skill to study the horses and make a prediction - that they think a particular horse will win a particular race. We take those tipsters predictions and put them through a machine learning algorithm (microsoft azure) asking it to predict a 'win' or 'lose' based upon the tipsters performance history.
We have a database of approx. 39,000 bets using 31 odd tipsters. Fifteen tipsters are active and sixteen tipsters are inactive The betting history for the inactive tipsters is used in the dataset as it appears to add 'weight' to the system when considering active tips.
We have been using this system live for three months now and although it has it's ups and downs - it makes money! One bookmaker has already closed our account.
We are looking to further optimize the system to reach it's maximum efficiency coupled with a betting strategy to increase profitability. We ask for your help. If you can produce an 'Azure' system more efficient than ours - then further information will be shared with you.
Questions
Are bets from inactive tipsters critical to performance?
Is it better to have all the tipsters 'stacked on top of each other' in one large dataset or is the system better served by separating them out?
Predicting Bets
When we ask the system to predict if a bet will Win or Lose for say Tipster A - we take the last ID number for that Tipster and add one to it - making it a new ID - outside the systems experience. That ID is used for all that Tipsters bets until the system is updated. The system is updated once a week.
Good hunting.

Summary
The data was scraped using a Python code. The code can be located at Github: https://github.com/kendallgillies/NFL-Statistics-Scrape
Explanation of Data
The first main group of statistics is the basic statistics provided for each player. This data is stored in the CSV file titled Basic_Stats.csv along with the player‚Äôs name and URL identifier. If available the data pulled for each player is as follows:
Number
Position
Current Team
Height
Weight
Age
Birthday
Birth Place
College Attended
High School Attended
High School Location
Experience
The second main group of statistics gathered for each player are their career statistics. While each player has a main position they play, they will have statistics in other areas; therefore, the career statistics are divided into statistics types. The statistics are then stored in CSV files based on statistic type along with the player name, URL identifier and position (if available). The following are the career statistics types and accompanying CSV file names:
Defensive Statistics ‚Äì Career_Stats_Defensive.csv
Field Goal Kickers - Career_Stats_Field_Goal_Kickers.csv
Fumbles - Career_Stats_Fumbles.csv
Kick Return - Career_Stats_Kick_Return.csv

Passing - Career_Stats_Passing.csv
Punt Return - Career_Stats_Punt_Return.csv
Punting - Career_Stats_Punting.csv
Receiving - Career_Stats_Receiving.csv
Rushing - Career_Stats_Rushing.csv
The final group of statistics is the game logs for each player. The game logs are stored by position and have the player name, URL identifier and position (if available). The following are the game log types and accompanying CSV file names:
Quarterback ‚Äì Game_Logs_Quarterback.csv

Daily Happiness & Employee Turnover,Is There a Relationship Between Employee Happiness and Job Turnover?,Jose Berengueres,35,"Version 3,2017-08-07|Version 2,2017-08-07|Version 1,2017-08-05",economics,CSV,49 MB,ODbL,"8,454 views",927 downloads,9 kernels,3 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/harriken/employeeturnover,"Can Happiness Predict Employee Turnover, or is it the Other Way Around?
It is the summer of 2016. I am in Barcelona and it is hot and humid. By chance I go to a talk where Alex Rios - the ceo of myhappyforce.com explains his product. He has built an app where employees report daily happiness levels at work. This app is used by companies to track happiness of the workforce. After the talk I ask him if he would opensource the (anonymized data) so we can better understad the phenomenon of employee turnover. Here is what we did, we developed a model that predicts which employees will churn. Then we looked at the features (used by the model) that are common to employees that churn. The top feautures of employees that churn are:
low ratio of likes received (likeability)
low posting frequency (engagement),
low relative happiness (employee happiness normalized by company mean).
Surprisingly, a priori expected explanatory features such as mean happiness level and the ratio of likes (positivity), were not significant. Precision@50 = 80% out of a test set with 116 churns, sample size N=2k. Another surprise was that raw happiness is a bad predictor of churn. But, the question is, What did we miss? Can you find more insights?
Starter script
R starter script https://www.kaggle.com/harriken/how-many-unlikes-it-takes-to-get-fired
Content
The data consists of four tables: votes, comments, interactions and churn. A vote was obtained when an employee opened the app and answered the question: How happy are you at work today? To vote the employee indicates their feeling by touching one of four icons that appeared on the screen. After the employee indicates their happiness level, a second screen appears where they can input a text explanation (usually a complaint, suggestion or comment), this is the comments table. Out of 4,356 employees, 2,638 employees commented at least once. Finally, in a third screen the employee can see their peers‚Äô comments and like or dislike them, this data is stored in the interactions table. 3,516 employees liked or disliked at least one of their peers‚Äô comments. The churn table contains when an employee churned (quit or was fired).

Inspiration
The cost of employee turnover has been pointed out extensively in the literature. A high turnover rate not only increases human resource costs, which can reach up to 150% of the annual salary per replaced employee, but it also has social costs, as it is correlated with lower wages, lower productivity per employee, and not surprisingly, a less loyal workforce 1. For reference, in 2006, turnover at Walmart‚Äôs Sam‚Äôs Club was 44% with an average hourly pay of $10.11, while at Costco it was a much lower 17% with a higher $17.0 hourly wage 2. In addition, a more recent study correlated companies with low turnover with a series of socially positive characteristics dubbed high-involvement work practices 3. On the other hand, research on employee turnover (churn) is not a prolific topic in the engineering community. In IEEE publications, one can find just over 278 publications with titles containing the keyword churn, and the bulk of those focus on customer churn, and specifically churn in the telecommunications industry, while on the topic of employee churn there is just one title indexed 4. The goal is to clarify the characteristics of employees that will churn (or that are at risk of churning), to help companies understand the causes so they can reduce the turnover rate."

An Open Dataset for Human Activity Analysis,"Data collected using Smartphone, Smartwatch and Smartglasses",Sasan Jafarnejad,35,"Version 3,2017-09-01|Version 2,2017-08-31|Version 1,2017-08-31",consumer electronics,CSV,434 MB,ODbL,"7,367 views",665 downloads,,2 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/sasanj/human-activity-smart-devices,"Context
The study of human mobility and activities has opened up to an incredible number of studies in the past, most of which included the use of sensors distributed on the body of the subject. More recently, the use of smart devices has been particularly relevant because they are already everywhere and they come with accurate miniaturized sensors. Whether it is smartphones, smartwatches or smartglasses, each device can be used to describe complementary information such as emotions, precise movements, or environmental conditions.
Content
First of all, a smartphone is used to capture mainly contextual data. Two applications are used: a simple data collection application based on the SWIPE open-source sensing system (SWIPE), and a logbook application for obtaining real data on user activity (TimeLogger). SWIPE is a platform for sensing, recording and processing human dynamics using smartwatches and smartphones.
Then, a smartwatch is used primarily to capture the user's heart rate. Motion data is also collected, without being at the heart of the dataset due to its need to be configured with a low sampling frequency, which would drastically increase the dataset and drain the battery as well. An application based on SWIPE is used.
Finally, JINS MEME smartglasses are used. This model has the advantage of being compact and simple to carry. It does not have a camera or a screen; it simply has three types of sensors: an accelerometer (for detecting steps or activities), a gyroscope (for head movements) and an occulographic sensor (eye blinking, eye orientation). The official DataLogger application from JINS MEME is used.
For more information on the dataset please refer to the corresponding publication, available at An Open Dataset for Human Activity Analysis using Smart Devices.
The current dataset on Kaggle contains smartglasses data with 20ms interval (due to storage limitations), same data with 10ms interval is also available on demand. Contact sasan.jafarnejad [at] uni [dot] lu to receive the 10ms version.

This is a collection of over 50,000 ranked EUW games from the game League of Legends, as well as json files containing a way to convert between champion and summoner spell IDs and their names. For each game, there are fields for:
Game ID
Creation Time (in Epoch format)
Game Duration (in seconds)
Season ID
Winner (1 = team1, 2 = team2)
First Baron, dragon, tower, blood, inhibitor and Rift Herald (1 = team1, 2 = team2, 0 = none)
Champions and summoner spells for each team (Stored as Riot's champion and summoner spell IDs)
The number of tower, inhibitor, Baron, dragon and Rift Herald kills each team has
The 5 bans of each team (Again, champion IDs are used)
This dataset was collected using the Riot Games API, which makes it easy to lookup and collect information on a users ranked history and collect their games. However finding a list of usernames is the hard part, in this case I am using a list of usernames scraped from 3rd party LoL sites.
Possible Uses
There is a vast amount of data in just a single LoL game. This dataset takes the most relevant information and makes it available easily for use in things such as attempting to predict the outcome of a LoL game, analysing which in-game events are most likely to lead to victory, understanding how big of an effect bans of a specific champion have, and more."

‚ÄúMeetup is a social networking website that aims to brings people together to do, explore, teach and learn the things that help them come alive.‚Äù
Meetup allows members to find and join groups unified by a common interest. As of 2017, there are 32 million users with 280 thousand groups available across 182 countries.
A member needs to be able to identify groups and activities which interest them the most to be able to use this platform to network effectively.
The aim of our team was to use this dataset to build a recommender system which will identify and suggest groups and activities to a member based on their interest and additional interests of similar members. Furthermore, a social network analysis was done to identify the relationship between groups and people.

The online job market is a good indicator of overall demand for labor in the local economy. In addition, online job postings data are easier and quicker to collect, and they can be a richer source of information than more traditional job postings, such as those found in printed newspapers. The data can be used in the following ways: -Understand the demand for certain professions, job titles, or industries -Help universities with curriculum development -Identify skills that are most frequently required by employers, and how the distribution of necessary skills changes over time -Make recommendations to job seekers and employers

PUBG Match Deaths and Statistics,Over 65 million death entries for PlayerUnknown Battleground's matches,KP,34,"Version 3,2018-01-12|Version 2,2018-01-12|Version 1,2018-01-11","video games

demographics",Other,4 GB,CC0,"8,572 views",604 downloads,2 kernels,4 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/skihikingkevin/pubg-match-deaths,"Introduction
Video games are a rich area for data extraction due to its digital nature. Notable examples such as the complex EVE Online economy, World of Warcraft corrupted blood incident and even Grand Theft Auto self-driving cars tells us that fiction is closer to reality than we really think. Data scientists can gain insight on the logic and decision-making that the players face when put in hypothetical and virtual scenarios.
In this Kaggle Dataset, I provide over 720,000 competitive matches from the popular game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. The data was extracted from pubg.op.gg, a game tracker website. I intend for this data-set to be purely exploratory, however users are free to create their own predictive models they see fit.
PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds
PUBG is a first/third-person shooter battle royale style game that matches over 90 players on a large island where teams and players fight to the death until one remains. Players are airdropped from an airplane onto the island where they are to scavenge towns and buildings for weapons, ammo, armor and first-aid. Players will then decide to either fight or hide with the ultimate goal of being the last one standing. A bluezone (see below) will appear a few minutes into the game to corral players closer and closer together by dealing damage to anyone that stands within the bluezone and sparing whoever is within the safe zone.
Read more about PUBG here
The Dataset
This dataset provides two zips: aggregate and deaths.
In deaths, the files record every death that occurred within the 720k matches. That is, each row documents an event where a player has died in the match.
In aggregate, each match's meta information and player statistics are summarized (as provided by pubg). It includes various aggregate statistics such as player kills, damage, distance walked, etc as well as metadata on the match itself such as queue size, fpp/tpp, date, etc.
The uncompressed data is divided into 5 chunks of approximately 2gb each. For details on columns, please see the file descriptions.
Interpreting Positional Data
The X,Y coordinates are all in in-game coordinates and need to be linearly scaled to be plotted on square erangel and miramar maps. The coordinate min,max are 0,800000 respectively.
Potential Bias in the Data
The scraping methodology first starts with an initial seed player, I chose this to be my own account (a rather low rank individual). I then use the seed player to scrape for all players that it has encountered in its historical matches. I then take a random subset of 5000 players from this and then scrape for their historical games for the final dataset. What this could produce is an unrepresentative sample of all games played as it is more likely that I queued and matched with lower rated players and those players more than likely also got matched against lower rated players as well. Thus, the matches and deaths are more representative of lower tier gameplay but given the simplicity of the dataset, this shouldn't be an issue.

The image at the top of the page is a frame from today's (7/26/2016) Isis #TweetMovie from twitter, a ""normal"" day when two Isis operatives murdered a priest saying mass in a French church. (You can see this in the center left). A selection of data from this site is being made available here to Kaggle users.
UPDATE: An excellent study by Audrey Alexander titled Digital Decay? is now available which traces the ""change over time among English-language Islamic State sympathizers on Twitter.
Intent
This data set is intended to be a counterpoise to the How Isis Uses Twitter data set. That data set contains 17k tweets alleged to originate with ""100+ pro-ISIS fanboys"". This new set contains 122k tweets collected on two separate days, 7/4/2016 and 7/11/2016, which contained any of the following terms, with no further editing or selection:
isis
isil
daesh
islamicstate
raqqa
Mosul
""islamic state""
This is not a perfect counterpoise as it almost surely contains a small number of pro-Isis fanboy tweets. However, unless some entity, such as Kaggle, is willing to expend significant resources on a service something like an expert level Mechanical Turk or Zooniverse, a high quality counterpoise is out of reach.
A counterpoise provides a balance or backdrop against which to measure a primary object, in this case the original pro-Isis data. So if anyone wants to discriminate between pro-Isis tweets and other tweets concerning Isis you will need to model the original pro-Isis data or signal against the counterpoise which is signal + noise. Further background and some analysis can be found in this forum thread.
This data comes from postmodernnews.com/token-tv.aspx which daily collects about 25MB of Isis tweets for the purposes of graphical display. PLEASE NOTE: This server is not currently active.
Data Details
There are several differences between the format of this data set and the pro-ISIS fanboy dataset. 1. All the twitter t.co tags have been expanded where possible 2. There are no ""description, location, followers, numberstatuses"" data columns.
I have also included my version of the original pro-ISIS fanboy set. This version has all the t.co links expanded where possible."

Generating humor is a complex task in the domain of machine learning, and it requires the models to understand the deep semantic meaning of a joke in order to generate new ones. Such problems, however, are difficult to solve due to a number of reasons, one of which is the lack of a database that gives an elaborate list of jokes. Thus, a large corpus of over 0.2 million jokes has been collected by scraping several websites containing funny and short jokes.
Visit my Github repository for more information regarding collection of data and the scripts used.
Content
This dataset is in the form of a csv file containing 231,657 jokes. Length of jokes ranges from 10 to 200 characters. Each line in the file contains a unique ID and joke.
Disclaimer
It has been attempted to keep the jokes as clean as possible. Since the data has been collected by scraping websites, it is possible that there may be a few jokes that are inappropriate or offensive to some people."

I love movies. 
I tend to avoid marvel-transformers-standardized products, and prefer a mix of classic hollywood-golden-age and obscure polish artsy movies. Throw in an occasional japanese-zombie-slasher-giallo as an alibi. Good movies don't exist without bad movies. 
On average I watch 200+ movies each year, with peaks at more than 500 movies. Nine years ago I started to log my movies to avoid watching the same movie twice, and also assign scores. Over the years, it gave me a couple insights on my viewing habits but nothing more than what a tenth-grader would learn at school. 
I've recently suscribed to Netflix and it pains me to see the global inefficiency of recommendation systems for people like me, who mostly swear by ""La politique des auteurs"". It's a term coined by famous new-wave french movie critic Andr√© Bazin, meaning that the quality of a movie is essentially linked to the director and it's capacity to execute his vision with his crew. We could debate it depends on movie production pipeline, but let's not for now. Practically, what it means, is that I essentially watch movies from directors who made films I've liked.
I suspect Neflix calibrate their recommandation models taking into account the way the ""average-joe"" chooses a movie. A few months ago I had read a study based on a survey, showing that people chose a movie mostly based on genre (55%), then by leading actors (45%). Director or Release Date were far behind around 10% each. It is not surprising, since most people I know don't care who the director is. Lots of US blockbusters don't even mention it on the movie poster. I am aware that collaborative filtering is based on user proximity , which I believe decreases (or even eliminates) the need to characterize a movie. So here I'm more interested in content based filtering which is based on product proximity for several reasons :
Users tastes are not easily accessible. It is, after all, Netflix treasure chest
Movie offer on Netflix is so bad for someone who likes author's movies that it wouldn't help
Modeling a movie intrinsic qualities is a nice challenge
Enough.

Content
The primary source is www.themoviedb.org. If you watch obscure artsy romanian homemade movies you may find only 95% of your movies referenced...but for anyone else it should be in the 98%+ range.
movies details are from www.themoviedb.org API : movies/details
movies crew & casting are from www.themoviedb.org API : movies/credits
both can be joined by id
they contain all 350k movies up, from end of 19th century to august 2017. If you remove short movies from imdb you get similar amounts of movies.
I uploaded the program to retrieve incremental movie details on github : https://github.com/stephanerappeneau/scienceofmovies/tree/master/PycharmProjects/GetAllMovies (need a dev API key from themoviedb.org though)
I have tried various supervised (decision tree) / unsupervised (clustering, NLP) approaches described in the discussions, source code is on github : https://github.com/stephanerappeneau/scienceofmovies
As a bonus I've uploaded the bio summary from top 500 critically-acclaimed directors from wikipedia, for some interesting NLTK analysis
Here is overview of the available sources that I've tried :
‚Ä¢ Imdb.com free csv dumps (ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/mirrors/ftp.imdb.com/pub/temporaryaccess/) are badly documented, incomplete, loosely structured and impossible to join/merge. There's an API hosted by Amazon Web Service : 1‚Ç¨ every 100 000 requests. With around 1 million movies, it could become expensive also features are bare. So I've searched for other sources. 
‚Ä¢ www.themoviedb.org is based on crowdsourcing and has an excellent API, limited to 40 requests every 10 seconds. It is quite generous, well documented, and enough to sweep the 450 000 movies in a few days. For my purpose, data quality is not significantly worse than imdb, and as imdb key is also included there's always the possibility to complete my dataset later (I actually did it)
‚Ä¢ www.Boxofficemojo.com has some interesting budget/revenue figures (which are sorely lacking in both imdb & tmdb), but it actually tracks only a few thousand movies, mainly blockbusters. There are other professional sources that are used by film industry to get better predictive / marketing insights but that's beyond my reach for this experiment.   ‚Ä¢ www.wikipedia.com is an interesting source with no real cap on API calls, however it requires a bit of webscraping and for movies or directors the layout and quality varies a lot, so I suspected it'd get a lot of work to get insights so I put this source in lower priority.
‚Ä¢ www.google.com will ban you after a few minutes of web scraping because their job is to scrap data from others, than sell it, duh.   ‚Ä¢ It's worth mentionning that there are a few dumps of Netflix anonymized user tastes on kaggle, because they've organised a few competitions to improve their recommendation models. https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data
‚Ä¢ Online databases are largely white anglo-saxon centric, meaning bollywood (India is the 2nd bigger producer of movies) offer is mostly absent from datasets. I'm fine with that, as it's not my cup of tea plus I lack domain knowledge. The sheer amount of indian movies would probably skew my results anyway (I don't want to have too many martial-arts-musicals in my recommendations ;-)). I have, however, tremendous respect for indian movie industry so I'd love to collaborate with an indian cinephile !

Starting from there, I had multiple problem statements for both supervised / unsupervised machine learning
Can I program a tailored-recommendation system based on my own criteria ?
What are the characteristics of movies/directors I like the most ?
What is the probability that I will like my next movie ?
Can I find the data ?
One of the objectives of sharing my work here is to find cinephile data-scientists who might be interested and, hopefully, contribute or share insights :) Other interesting leads : use tagline for NLP/Clustering/Genre guessing, leverage on budget/revenue, link with other data sources using the imdb normalized title, etc.

I've graduated from an french engineering school, majoring in artificial intelligence, but that was 17 years ago right in the middle of A.I-winter. Like a lot of white male rocket scientists, I've ended up in one of the leading european investment bank, quickly abandonning IT development to specialize in trading/risk project management and internal politics. My recent appointment in the Data Office made me aware of recent breakthroughts in datascience, and I thought that developing a side project would be an excellent occasion to learn something new. Plus it'd give me a well-needed credibility which too often lack decision makers when it comes to datascience.
I've worked on some of the features with C√©dric Paternotte, a fellow friend of mine who is a professor of philosophy of sciences in La Sorbonne. Working with someone with a different background seem a good idea for motivation, creativity and rigor.
Kudos to www.themoviedb.org or www.wikipedia.com sites, who really have a great attitude towards open data. This is typically NOT the case of modern-bigdata companies who mostly keep data to themselves to try to monetize it. Such a huge contrast with imdb or instagram API, which generously let you grab your last 3 comments at a miserable rate. Even if 15 years ago this seemed a mandatory path to get services for free, I predict one day governments will need to break this data monopoly.

Introduced in 1995, it has sold over 22 million copies worldwide. Learning how to play the game well requires an inherent understanding of probability, economics, game theory, and social interactions.
This is my personal dataset of 50 4-player games I played on playcatan.com in 2014. Using the ingame statistics page and a spreadsheet, I logged starting position choices, the distribution of dice rolls, and how each player spent the resources they acquired by the end of the game. Note, of course, because this dataset only consists of my games, any analysis done is most relevant for games involving me...
My personal analysis of this dataset consisted of a best subsets regression, and resulted a 4-variable model that likely overfitted, but managed to ascertain the winner correctly, in 40 of 50 games.
Questions to possibly consider:
How much luck is involved in winning a Catan game?
Does starting position matter? If so, what starting settlements lead to success from each position?
How much information on the eventual winner can be gained from starting position/settlements alone?
By looking at postgame stats, what leads to a win? Can these statistics be a guide for ingame strategy?
Data details/guide:
gameNum - each game I played has 4 corresponding rows, 1 per player.
player - the starting position corresponding to each row
points - how many points the player ended the game with (the game is won with 10 or more)
me - the position I played during the game
2, 3, ..., 12 - how many rolls of each value occurred during the game (game is played with 2 dice)
settlement1, settlement2 - each starting settlement is logged as 3 pairs of [number, resource]:
L = lumber
C = clay
S = sheep
W = wheat
O = ore
3G = 3:1 general port
2(X) = 2:1 port for resource X
D = desert
EX: in game 1, player 1's first settlement was on a 6-lumber, 3-clay, and 11-clay.
production - total cards gained from settlements and cities during game
tradeGain - total cards gained from peer AND bank trades during game
robberCardsGain - total cards gained from stealing with the robber, plus cards gained with non-knight development cards. A road building card is +4 resources.
totalGain - sum of previous 3 columns.
tradeLoss - total cards lost from peer AND bank trades during game
robberCardsLoss - total cards lost from robbers, knights, and other players' monopoly cards

What is a note?,A collection of notes played on a guitar,Melvyn Drag,32,"Version 4,2016-11-23|Version 3,2016-11-20|Version 2,2016-11-19|Version 1,2016-11-17",music,Other,14 MB,CC0,"5,866 views",382 downloads,15 kernels,,https://www.kaggle.com/juliancienfuegos/what-is-a-note,"Overview
We could take a music theory class to understand what a note is, but why don't we just find out for ourselves? In this data set we have the notes on a guitar on open strings, and on the 1st-8th frets on every string. The notes were recorded on a nice but low-end guitar called the Yamaha C-40. The guitar is in standard tuning (from the top string to the bottom on we have E low, A, D, G, B, E high).
What to do with this dataset
I didn't label any notes (except the open ones - an open A string is an A). If you want a challenge you can cluster the notes and see if your clustering lumps all the same notes together. If you want labels so you can do some inspection of notes that are the same you can look on google for a guitar fretboard diagram. I have done both of these experiments and learned a bit about music which I 'm hoping to verify soon when I find a good music theory book.
This data set might be interesting to use to be able to write sheet music from an audio sample of some finger-picked music. Identifying chords is a difficult computational task, but finger-style guitar, with clear, individual notes, might be easier. If this is the case, a simple script could be written to write sheet music from an audio sample.
One draw back about the data set is that some non-plucked strings were vibrating when I played a note. I tried various techniques to muffle them, but there is still some noise in the background. I don't know if this is because of my technique or something that happens to all players on all guitars. In any event, this noise didn't hurt my analysis.
About the data
They were recorded by me, Melvyn, using a program called audacity.
There is a directory with the name of the string. Inside the directory you will find .wav files named either open, 1, 2, ....8 for the fingering of the string. There is also a directory called ""scale"" I recorded some notes that make a ""do-re-mi..."" scale. You can use these for a number of things.
I use the GuitarTuner app to tune the Guitar - I'm just learning so I don't have an ear for notes yet. After some initial analysis it looks like the guitar might be a bit out of tune, so the resonant frequencies are a bit off from what they should be. Another thing that is interesting to think about it is how far a frequency must be from the proper on until it becomes distinguishable as a different note."

My thesis is that if you can accurately show emotional or physical change over time, you can objectively pinpoint how an environmental change such as a career change, moving to a new city, starting or ending a relationship, or starting a new habit like going to the gym affected your physical and emotional health. This can lead to important insights on an individual level and for a population as a whole.

Structural MRI images for visualization and image processing
From the instructors:
About this course: Neurohacking describes how to use the R programming language (https://cran.r-project.org/) and its associated packages to perform manipulation, processing, and analysis of neuroimaging data. We focus on publicly-available structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We discuss concepts such as inhomogeneity correction, image registration, and image visualization. By the end of this course, you will be able to: Read/write images of the brain in the NIfTI (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative) format Visualize and explore these images, perform inhomogeneity correction, brain extraction, and image registration (within a subject and to a template).

Notes
A. When you download the zip archive, double clicking might try to compress the file instead of extracting it. Unzipping on terminal (mac) correctly decompresses the archive.
B. The zip file contains a directory structure:

However, when it is unzipped here on Kaggle environment, somehow the directory structure is not maintained, therefore files with the same names are being overwritten. As a workaround, I added the directory names to the files ie. BRAINIX_DICOM_T1_IM_0001_0011.dcm instead of just IM_0001_0011.dcm.

There are all sorts of reasons why you'd want to know a hospital's quality rating.
Your mom is having her second hip replacement. Her first one went terribly and you're nervous about how she'll do. Which hospital would you suggest she have her surgery?
You're selecting a health plan on your state's Exchange, but your top two choices partner with different hospitals. How will you decide which plan to pick?
Your brother has Cystic Fibrosis and has to go to the ER frequently. He hates waiting. Which hospitals/states provide care in the timeliest manner?
Your in-laws moved to Florida recently to retire, and have been trying to convince you to move there too. You're looking for any way possible to show them that your state is better. Does your state have better hospitals?
Every hospital in the United States of America that accepts publicly insured patients (Medicaid or MediCare) is required to submit quality data, quarterly, to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). There are very few hospitals that do not accept publicly insured patients, so this is quite a comprehensive list.
Content
This file contains general information about all hospitals that have been registered with Medicare, including their addresses, type of hospital, and ownership structure. It also contains information about the quality of each hospital, in the form of an overall rating (1-5, where 5 is the best possible rating & 1 is the worst), and whether the hospital scored above, same as, or below the national average for a variety of measures.
This data was updated by CMS on July 25, 2017. CMS' overall rating includes 60 of the 100 measures for which data is collected & reported on Hospital Compare website (https://www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare/search.html). Each of the measures have different collection/reporting dates, so it is impossible to specify exactly which time period this dataset covers. For more information about the timeframes for each measure, see: https://www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare/Data/Data-Updated.html# For more information about the data itself, APIs and a variety of formats, see: https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare

SpaceX has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic milestones. It is the only private company ever to return a spacecraft from low-Earth orbit, which it first accomplished in December 2010. The company made history again in May 2012 when its Dragon spacecraft attached to the International Space Station, exchanged cargo payloads, and returned safely to Earth ‚Äî a technically challenging feat previously accomplished only by governments. Since then Dragon has delivered cargo to and from the space station multiple times, providing regular cargo resupply missions for NASA.
Under a $1.6 billion contract with NASA, SpaceX is flying numerous cargo resupply missions to the International Space Station, for a total of at least 20 flights under the Commercial Resupply Services contract. In 2016, NASA awarded SpaceX a second version of that contract that will cover a minimum of 6 additional flights from 2019 onward. In the near future, SpaceX will carry crew as part of NASA‚Äôs Commercial Crew Program as well. Dragon was designed from the outset to carry astronauts and SpaceX is in the process of upgrading Dragon to make it crew-ready. SpaceX is the world‚Äôs fastest-growing provider of launch services and has over 70 future missions on its manifest, representing over $10 billion in contracts. These include commercial satellite launches as well as NASA and other US Government missions.

The dataset contains a number of different subsets of the full food-101 data. The idea is to make a more exciting simple training set for image analysis than CIFAR10 or MNIST. For this reason the data includes massively downscaled versions of the images to enable quick tests. The data has been reformatted as HDF5 and specifically Keras HDF5Matrix which allows them to be easily read in. The file names indicate the contents of the file. For example
food_c101_n1000_r384x384x3.h5 means there are 101 categories represented, with n=1000 images, that have a resolution of 384x384x3 (RGB, uint8)
food_test_c101_n1000_r32x32x1.h5 means the data is part of the validation set, has 101 categories represented, with n=1000 images, that have a resolution of 32x32x1 (float32 from -1 to 1)
Challenge
The first goal is to be able to automatically classify an unknown image using the dataset, but beyond this there are a number of possibilities for looking at what regions / image components are important for making classifications, identify new types of food as combinations of existing tags, build object detectors which can find similar objects in a full scene.

Who amongst us doesn't small talk about the weather every once in a while?
The goal of this dataset is to elevate this small talk to medium talk.
Just kidding, I actually originally decided to collect this dataset in order to demonstrate basic signal processing concepts, such as filtering, Fourier transform, auto-correlation, cross-correlation, etc..., (for a data analysis course I'm currently preparing).
I wanted to demonstrate these concepts on signals that we all have intimate familiarity with and hope that this way these concepts will be better understood than with just made up signals.
The weather is excellent for demonstrating these kinds of concepts as it contains periodic temporal structure with two very different periods (daily and yearly).
Content
The dataset contains ~5 years of high temporal resolution (hourly measurements) data of various weather attributes, such as temperature, humidity, air pressure, etc.
This data is available for 30 US and Canadian Cities, as well as 6 Israeli cities.
I've organized the data according to a common time axis for easy use.
Each attribute has it's own file and is organized such that the rows are the time axis (it's the same time axis for all files), and the columns are the different cities (it's the same city ordering for all files as well).
Additionally, for each city we also have the country, latitude and longitude information in a separate file.

The dataset was aquired using Weather API on the OpenWeatherMap website, and is available under the ODbL License.
Inspiration
Weather data is both intrinsically interesting, and also potentially useful when correlated with other types of data.
For example, Wildfire spread is potentially related to weather conditions, demand for cabs is famously known to be correlated with weather conditions (here, here and here you can find NYC cab ride data), and use of city bikes is probably also correlated with weather in interesting ways (check out this Austin dataset, this SF dataset, this Montreal dataset, and this NYC dataset).
Traffic is also probably related to weather.
Another potentially interesting source of correlation is between weather and crime. Here are a few crime datasets on kaggle of cities present in this weather dataset: Chicago, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Vancouver, Austin, NYC
There are many other potentially interesting connections between everyday life and the weather that we can explore together with the help of this dataset. Have fun!"

SEPTA uses On-Time Performance (OTP) to measure service reliability. OTP identifies the number of trains for all rail lines that arrive at their scheduled destination at the scheduled time. However, by industry standard, a train may arrive up to 5 minutes and 59 seconds after its scheduled time and still be considered on-time.

What To Look For...
Ah, as a commuter you care more about the performance of the train(s) you plan to take. OTP maybe 91% or above; but, if the train you take runs late, you'll spend extra time on the tracks. If it consistently runs late, maybe the schedule should be changed.
Look for patterns. For example, during the Tuesday morning rush do some trains run consistently late? How long does it take to get to from point A to point B in the system? Performance is VERY important to SEPTA.
Below is a map of the system and station stops. This dataset contains data on the Regional Rail Lines.
SEPTA train schedules can be found here. Note different Weekday, Saturday, and Sunday schedules."

This dataset is born from a test with the twitter streaming api to filter and collect data from this flow on a specific topic, in this case the French election.The script used to make this data collection is available on this Github repository.
Since the 18th of March, the French election enter in the final straight line until the first poll the 23 April 2017 , the candidates for the position are:
M. Nicolas DUPONT-AIGNAN
Mme Marine LE PEN
M. Emmanuel MACRON
M. Beno√Æt HAMON
Mme Nathalie ARTHAUD
M. Philippe POUTOU
M. Jacques CHEMINADE
M. Jean LASSALLE
M. Jean-Luc M√âLENCHON
M. Fran√ßois ASSELINEAU
M. Fran√ßois FILLON
The idea was to collect the data from the Twitter API periodically. The acquisition process evolved as follows:
Versions 1, 2 and 3 Every hour a python script listens to the twitter api stream for 10 minutes during 3 weeks.
Version 4+ The new versions will be based on a new data structure, and start after the validation by the French constitutional council on 18 March 2017 of the candidates.
The data will be stored in a dbsqlite files(database_number of the week_number_block_weekday.sqlite format) and will be updated as often as I can (at least every week).
After the first round (version 18+) i had to readjust the number of files per week and the 20 files kaggle limitation push me to reduce the number of files to upload (but you can join for your local analytics the version 17 + version 18+)
Example : Illustration of the number of mentions of the different candidates
I add to these databases a sqlite database that contains the informations from the google trends about the top 5 candidates.In thid database there is :
A table that contains the overall interests by region
A table that contains the interests by region for each candidate
A table with the top25 associated queries for each candidate in top and rising ranking
Content
In this dbsqlite file, you will find a data table that contains for every row:
===============Common===============
the index of the line
the language of the tweet
for each candidate :mention_candidatename, if the candidate or his associated account has been called (0 or 1)
the tweet
the timestamp in milliseconds
===============Version 4+===============
the day
the hour (London timezone)
the username of the user that made the tweet
the username location (that he gives with his profile)
if the tweet is a retweet or a quote (0 or 1)
the username that has been retweeted

This dataset comes from a proof-of-concept study published in 1999 by Golub et al. It showed how new cases of cancer could be classified by gene expression monitoring (via DNA microarray) and thereby provided a general approach for identifying new cancer classes and assigning tumors to known classes. These data were used to classify patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

Brazilian politicians are entitled to refunds if they spend any of their money on an activity that is enabling them to ""better serve the people"".
Those expenses are public data, however, there is little monitoring/data analysis of it. A quick look at it shows a deputy with over 800 flights in one year. Another deputy has over 140.000R$ expenses on mailing (old fashion mail) in one year.
There are a lot of very suspicious data regarding the deputies expending behavior. Can you help spot outliers and companies charging unusual amounts of money for a service?

In January 2017, PAVIC submitted a survey focused on Smart City and collected data from 1076 people. This survey was fully anonymous and was aimed at improving the citizens' lives in the future Smart City
Content
The idea of the survey is to obtain a precise insight concerning the citizens' reactions to different recommendations in two different contexts. In clear, respondents were asked to choose among a set of 18 recommendations those that they would be most interested in if it were proposed in two different contexts: on a sunny and warm (20¬∞C) Saturday afternoon in Spring (referred to as the ""Sun"" context) and on a rainy and cold (8¬∞C) Saturday afternoon in Winter (referred to as the ""Rain"" context). The recommendations concerned various subjects : social or cultural events, discounts in restaurants, useful city information, etc. and people were asked in each context which they would like to receive as push notifications on their phones. For each context, respondents could give several or no responses.
The following are the precise text of the questions submitted to the respondents : - for the ""Sun"" dataset : A Saturday in spring around 4pm with a comfy temperature of 20¬∞C or 68¬∞F. You are downtown in the city for the afternoon and your mobile application can send you personalized services/activities notifications in real-time. Which of the following activities would you want to receive in your notifications ? (Several may be chosen). - for the ""Rain"" dataset : A rainy Saturday in the winter around 4pm with a cool temperature of 8¬∞C or 46¬∞F. You are downtown in the city for the afternoon and your mobile application can send you personalized services/activities notifications in real-time. Which of the following activities would you want to receive in your notifications ? (Several may be chosen).

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) selected the first group of astronauts in 1959. From 500 candidates with the required jet aircraft flight experience and engineering training in addition to a height below 5 feet 11 inches, seven military men became the nation's first astronauts. The second and third groups chosen included civilians with extensive flying experience. By 1964, requirements had changed, and emphasis was placed on academic qualifications; in 1965, six scientist astronauts were selected from a group of 400 applicants who had a doctorate or equivalent experience in the natural sciences, medicine, or engineering. The group named in 1978 was the first of space shuttle flight crews and fourteen groups have been selected since then with a mix of pilots and mission specialists.
There are currently 50 active astronauts and 35 management astronauts in the program; 196 astronauts have retired or resigned and 49 are deceased (as of April 2013).

This dataset is a record of every building or building unit (apartment, etc.) sold in the New York City property market over a 12-month period.
Content
This dataset contains the location, address, type, sale price, and sale date of building units sold. A reference on the trickier fields:
BOROUGH: A digit code for the borough the property is located in; in order these are Manhattan (1), Bronx (2), Brooklyn (3), Queens (4), and Staten Island (5).
BLOCK; LOT: The combination of borough, block, and lot forms a unique key for property in New York City. Commonly called a BBL.
BUILDING CLASS AT PRESENT and BUILDING CLASS AT TIME OF SALE: The type of building at various points in time. See the glossary linked to below.
For further reference on individual fields see the Glossary of Terms. For the building classification codes see the Building Classifications Glossary.
Note that because this is a financial transaction dataset, there are some points that need to be kept in mind:
Many sales occur with a nonsensically small dollar amount: $0 most commonly. These sales are actually transfers of deeds between parties: for example, parents transferring ownership to their home to a child after moving out for retirement.
This dataset uses the financial definition of a building/building unit, for tax purposes. In case a single entity owns the building in question, a sale covers the value of the entire building. In case a building is owned piecemeal by its residents (a condominium), a sale refers to a single apartment (or group of apartments) owned by some individual.
Acknowledgements
This dataset is a concatenated and slightly cleaned-up version of the New York City Department of Finance's Rolling Sales dataset.

Arabic Handwritten Characters Dataset,Arabic Handwritten Characters Data-set,Mohamed Loey,28,"Version 1,2017-06-23",,CSV,73 MB,ODbL,"4,195 views",488 downloads,3 kernels,,https://www.kaggle.com/mloey1/ahcd1,"Arabic Handwritten Characters Dataset
Astract
Handwritten Arabic character recognition systems face several challenges, including the unlimited variation in human handwriting and large public databases. In this work, we model a deep learning architecture that can be effectively apply to recognizing Arabic handwritten characters. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a special type of feed-forward multilayer trained in supervised mode. The CNN trained and tested our database that contain 16800 of handwritten Arabic characters. In this paper, the optimization methods implemented to increase the performance of CNN. Common machine learning methods usually apply a combination of feature extractor and trainable classifier. The use of CNN leads to significant improvements across different machine-learning classification algorithms. Our proposed CNN is giving an average 5.1% misclassification error on testing data.
Context
The motivation of this study is to use cross knowledge learned from multiple works to enhancement the performance of Arabic handwritten character recognition. In recent years, Arabic handwritten characters recognition with different handwriting styles as well, making it important to find and work on a new and advanced solution for handwriting recognition. A deep learning systems needs a huge number of data (images) to be able to make a good decisions.
Content
The data-set is composed of 16,800 characters written by 60 participants, the age range is between 19 to 40 years, and 90% of participants are right-hand. Each participant wrote each character (from ‚Äôalef‚Äô to ‚Äôyeh‚Äô) ten times on two forms as shown in Fig. 7(a) & 7(b). The forms were scanned at the resolution of 300 dpi. Each block is segmented automatically using Matlab 2016a to determining the coordinates for each block. The database is partitioned into two sets: a training set (13,440 characters to 480 images per class) and a test set (3,360 characters to 120 images per class). Writers of training set and test set are exclusive. Ordering of including writers to test set are randomized to make sure that writers of test set are not from a single institution (to ensure variability of the test set).
In an experimental section we showed that the results were promising with 94.9% classification accuracy rate on testing images. In future work, we plan to work on improving the performance of handwritten Arabic character recognition.

Creating the proposed database presents more challenges because it deals with many issues such as style of writing, thickness, dots number and position. Some characters have different shapes while written in the same position. For example the teh character has different shapes in isolated position.

50 Years of Pop Music Lyrics
Billboard has published a Year-End Hot 100 every December since 1958. The chart measures the performance of singles in the U.S. throughout the year. Using R, I‚Äôve combined the lyrics from 50 years of Billboard Year-End Hot 100 (1965-2015) into one dataset for analysis. You can download that dataset here.
The songs used for analysis were scraped from Wikipedia‚Äôs entry for each Billboard Year-End Hot 100 Songs (e.g., 2014). This is the year-end chart, not weekly rankings. Many artists have made the weekly chart but not the final year end chart. The final chart is calculated using an inverse point system based on the weekly Billboard charts (100 points for a week at number one, 1 point for a week at number 100, etc).
I used the xml and RCurl packages to scrape song and artist names from each Wikipedia entry. I then used that list to scrape lyrics from sites that had predictable URL strings (for example, metrolyrics.com uses metrolyrics.com/SONG-NAME-lyrics-ARTIST-NAME.html). If the first site scrape failed, I moved onto the second, and so on. About 78.9% of the lyrics were scraped from metrolyics.com, 15.7% from songlyrics.com, 1.8% from lyricsmode.com. About 3.6% (187/5100) were unavailable.
The dataset features 5100 observations with the features rank (1-100), song, artist, year, lyrics, and source. The artist feature is fairly standardized thanks to Wikipedia, but there is still quite a bit of noise when it comes to artist collaborations (Justin Timberlake featuring Timbaland, for example). If there were any errors in the lyrics that were scraped, such as spelling errors or derivatives like ""nite"" instead of ""night,"" they haven't been corrected.
Full analysis can be found here.

Since Jan. 1, 2015, The Washington Post has been compiling a database of every fatal shooting in the US by a police officer in the line of duty. It's difficult to find reliable data from before this period, as police killings haven't been comprehensively documented, and the statistics on police brutality are much less available. As a result, a vast number of cases go unreported.
The Washington Post is tracking more than a dozen details about each killing - including the race, age and gender of the deceased, whether the person was armed, and whether the victim was experiencing a mental-health crisis. They have gathered this information from law enforcement websites, local new reports, social media, and by monitoring independent databases such as ""Killed by police"" and ""Fatal Encounters"". The Post has also conducted additional reporting in many cases.
There are four additional datasets. These are US census data on poverty rate, high school graduation rate, median household income, and racial demographics.

Context
The Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) is an integrated database of climate summaries from land surface stations across the globe. This data set contains gridded mean temperature anomalies, or departures from a reference value or long-term average, from the Global Historical Climatology Network-Monthly (GHCN-M) version 3.2.1 temperature data set. The gridded anomalies were produced from GHCN-M bias corrected data. Each month of data consists of 2,592 gridded data points produced on a 5¬∞ by 5¬∞ basis for the entire globe (72 longitude by 36 latitude grid boxes).
Frequency: Monthly
Period: 1880 to 2016
Content
Gridded data for every month from January 1880 to the most recent month is available. The data are temperature anomalies in degrees Celsius. Each gridded value was multiplied by 100 and written to file as an integer. Missing values are represented by the value -9999. The data are formatted by year, month, latitude and longitude. There are 72 longitude grid values per line -- each grid is labeled as a concatenation of ""lon"", ""w"" or ""e"", then the degree. The latitude is captured in the ""lat"" field where the value indicates the lower bound of a grid cell (e.g. 85 indicates 85-90N whereas -90 indicates 85-90S). Longitude values are written from 180¬∞W to 180¬∞E, and latitude values from 90¬∞N to 90¬∞S.
This dataset permits the quantification of changes in the mean monthly temperature and precipitation for the earth's surface. Changes in the observing system itself have been carefully removed to allow for the true climate variability at the earth's surface to be represented in the data.
Many surface weather stations undergo minor relocations through their history of observation. Stations may also be subject to changes in instrumentation as measurement technology evolves. Further, the land use/land cover in the vicinity of an observing site may also change with time. Such modifications to an observing site have the potential to alter a thermometer's microclimate exposure characteristics and/or change the bias of measurements, the impact of which can be a systematic shift in the mean level of temperature readings that is unrelated to true climate variations. The process of removing such ""non-climatic"" artifacts in a climate time series is called homogenization. In version 3 of the GHCN-Monthly temperature data, the apparent impacts of documented and undocumented inhomogeneities are detected and removed through automated pairwise comparisons of mean monthly temperature series as detailed in Menne and Williams [2009].

The Global Historical Climatology Network-Monthly (GHCN-M) temperature dataset was first developed in the early 1990s (Vose et al. 1992). A second version was released in 1997 following extensive efforts to increase the number of stations and length of the data record (Peterson and Vose, 1997). Methods for removing inhomogeneities from the data record associated with non-climatic influences such as changes in instrumentation, station environment, and observing practices that occur over time were also included in the version 2 release (Peterson and Easterling, 1994; Easterling and Peterson 1995). Since that time efforts have focused on continued improvements in dataset development methods including new quality control processes and advanced techniques for removing data inhomogeneities (Menne and Williams, 2009).

Brazil has elections every two years, but alternating between two different types of elections, each type occurring every four years. There are the municipal elections, where mayors and city council members are elected (the last one occurred in 2016) and general elections where president, governors, senators and congressmen (regional and national) are elected (the last one occurred in 2014). Brazil has 26 federal units plus the federal district. Each one of these units (regions) elects its senators, congressmen and governors.
For each federal unit, Brazil's TSE provides information on the donations declared by the three entities: candidates, parties and committees. The data comprises information describing every donation received. The donations can be divided in two categories with respect to the donor: they can come from legal persons (private citizens, identified by the CPF (CPF is an identification number used by the Brazilian tax revenue office. It is roughly the Brazilian analogue to a social security number. With the same purpose, companies are identified with a similar number called CNPJ number) or from legal entities (i.e. companies, identified by the CNPJ number). Also, some entities can make donations among them (the party can give part of the money from a given donation to a candidate). In this type of transaction, the information on the original donor is also specified in the declarations. From now on, these type of donations will be referred to as non-original donations. Apart from information concerning each Brazilian federal unit separately, one can also obtain the information declared by the parties and committees at national level and for the presidential campaign (which has national and not regional scope).

The data are a time-series of fluorescence images measured of at OHSU Lab of Charles Allen (https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/research/centers-institutes/oregon-institute-occupational-health-sciences/research/allen/).
Introduction
We use a fluorescent protein as a reporter for the circadian clock gene Period1. We are able to follow the expression of this gene in many neurons for several days to understand how the neural network in the suprachiasmatic nucleus synchronizes the circadian clock of individual neurons to produce a precise circadian rhythm. We analyze each image to determine the fluorescence intensity of each neuron over multiple circadian cycles.
FAQ
How where the images obtained: which animal and what staining?
The images were taken from a transgenic mouse in which expression of the fluorescent protein Venus is driven by the promoter for the circadian clock gene Period 1.
What is the anatomy of the images, and how are they oriented?
The bright line is the third ventricle, which resides on the midline of the brain. The two bright regions on either side of the ventricle are the two portions of the Suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Below the ventricle and the SCN is a dark horizontal band that represents the optic chasm.
What is the bright vertical line in the top middle?
The bright line is the third ventricle. Pericytes that line the ventricle express the Venus at very high levels. We don't know the function of the circadian clock in these cells.
Challenge
Currently we have to analyze each experiment by hand to follow an individual through a couple hundred images. This takes several days. This problem is going to get worse because we have just purchased a new automated microscope stage that will allow us to simultaneously image from four suprachiasmatic nuclei.

The dataset contains historical product demand for a manufacturing company with footprints globally. The company provides thousands of products within dozens of product categories. There are four central warehouses to ship products within the region it is responsible for. Since the products are manufactured in different locations all over the world, it normally takes more than one month to ship products via ocean to different central warehouses. If forecasts for each product in different central with reasonable accuracy for the monthly demand for month after next can be achieved, it would be beneficial to the company in multiple ways. This dataset is all real-life data and products/warehouse and category information encoded.
Content
Product_Code: The product name encoded. Warehouse: Warehouse name encoded. Product_Category: Product Category for each Product_Code encoded. Date: The date customer needs the product. Order_Demand: single order qty.

Historical Sales and Active Inventory,Records of sold and unsold products and their characteristics,JamesS,27,"Version 3,2016-12-08|Version 2,2016-12-08|Version 1,2016-12-08","business
product",CSV,13 MB,Other,"18,882 views","2,483 downloads",34 kernels,4 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/flenderson/sales-analysis,"Context
Attached is a set of products in which we are trying to determine which products we should continue to sell, and which products to remove from our inventory. The file contains BOTH historical sales data AND active inventory, which can be discerned with the column titled ""File Type"".
We suspect that data science applied to the set--such as a decision tree analysis or logistic regression, or some other machine learning model---can help us generate a value (i.e., probability score) for each product, that can be used as the main determinant evaluating the inventory. Each row in the file represents one product.
It is important to note that we have MANY products in our inventory, and very few of them tend to sell (only about 10% sell each year) and many of the products only have a single sale in the course of a year.
Content
The file contains historical sales data (identified with the column titled File_Type) along with current active inventory that is in need of evaluation (i.e., File Type = ""Active""). The historical data shows sales for the past 6 months. The binary target (1 = sale, 0 = no sale in past six months) is likely the primary target that should drive the analysis.
The other columns contain numeric and categorical attributes that we deem relevant to sales.
Note that some of the historical sales SKUs are ALSO included in the active inventory.
A few comments about the attributes included, as we realize we may have some attributes that are unnecessary or may need to be explained.
SKU_number: This is the unique identifier for each product.
Order: Just a sequential counter. Can be ignored.
SoldFlag: 1 = sold in past 6 mos. 0 = Not sold
MarketingType = Two categories of how we market the product. This should probably be ignored, or better yet, each type should be considered independently.
New_Release_Flag = Any product that has had a future release (i.e., Release Number > 1)
Inspiration
(1) What is the best model to use that will provide us with a probability estimate of a sale for each SKU? We are mainly interested in a relative unit that we can continuously update based on these attributes (and others that we add, as we are able).
(2) Is it possible to provide a scored file (i.e., a probability score for each SKU in the file), and to provide an evaluation of the accuracy of the selected model?
(3) What are the next steps we should take?
Thanks very much for any suggestions you may provide."

The American Time Use Survey (ATUS) is the Nation‚Äôs first federally administered, continuous survey on time use in the United States. The goal of the survey is to measure how people divide their time among life‚Äôs activities.
In ATUS, individuals are randomly selected from a subset of households that have completed their eighth and final month of interviews for the Current Population Survey (CPS). ATUS respondents are interviewed only one time about how they spent their time on the previous day, where they were, and whom they were with. The survey is sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and is conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau.
The major purpose of ATUS is to develop nationally representative estimates of how people spend their time. Many ATUS users are interested in the amount of time Americans spend doing unpaid, nonmarket work, which could include unpaid childcare, eldercare, housework, and volunteering. The survey also provides information on the amount of time people spend in many other activities, such as religious activities, socializing, exercising, and relaxing. In addition to collecting data about what people did on the day before the interview, ATUS collects information about where and with whom each activity occurred, and whether the activities were done for one‚Äôs job or business. Demographic information‚Äîincluding sex, race, age, educational attainment, occupation, income, marital status, and the presence of children in the household‚Äîalso is available for each respondent. Although some of these variables are updated during the ATUS interview, most of this information comes from earlier CPS interviews, as the ATUS sample is drawn from a subset of households that have completed month 8 of the CPS.
The user guide can be found here.
Content
There are 8 datasets containing microdata from 2003-2015:
Respondent file: The Respondent file contains information about ATUS respondents, including their labor force status and earnings.
Roster file: The Roster file contains information about household members and nonhousehold children (under 18) of ATUS respondents. It includes information such as age and sex.
Activity file: The Activity file contains information about how ATUS respondents spent their diary day. It includes information such as activity codes, activity start and stop times, and locations. Because Activity codes have changed somewhat between 2003 and 2015, this file uses activity codes that appear in the 2003-2015 ATUS Coding Lexicon (PDF).
Activity summary file: The Activity summary file contains information about the total time each ATUS respondent spent doing each activity on the diary day. Because Activity codes have changed somewhat between 2003 and 2015, this file uses activity codes that appear in the 2003-2015 ATUS Coding Lexicon (PDF).
Who file: The Who file includes codes that indicate who was present during each activity.
CPS 2003-2015 file: The ATUS-CPS file contains information about each household member of all individuals selected to participate in ATUS. The information on the ATUS-CPS file was collected 2 to 5 months before the ATUS interview.
Eldercare Roster file: The ATUS Eldercare Roster file contains information about people for whom the respondent provided care. Eldercare data have been collected since 2011.
Replicate weights file: The Replicate weights file contains miscellaneous ATUS weights.

The World Religion Project aims to provide detailed information about religious adherence worldwide since 1945. It contains data about the number of adherents by religion in each of the states in the international system for every half-decade period. Some of the religions are divided into religious families, and the breakdown of adherents within a given religion into religious families is provided to the extent data are available.
The project was developed in three stages. The first stage consisted of the formation of a religions tree. A religion tree is a systematic classification of major religions and of religious families within those major religions. To develop the religion tree we prepared a comprehensive literature review, the aim of which was to define a religion, to find tangible indicators of a given religion of religious families within a major religion, and to identify existing efforts at classifying world religions. The second stage consisted of the identification of major data sources of religious adherence and the collection of data from these sources according to the religion tree classification. This created a dataset that included multiple records for some states for a given point in time, yet contained multiple missing data for specific states, specific time periods, and specific religions. The third stage consisted of cleaning the data, reconciling discrepancies of information from different sources, and imputing data for the missing cases.

Common Voice is a corpus of speech data read by users on the Common Voice website (http://voice.mozilla.org/), and based upon text from a number of public domain sources like user submitted blog posts, old books, movies, and other public speech corpora. Its primary purpose is to enable the training and testing of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems.
Structure
The corpus is split into several parts for your convenience. The subsets with ‚Äúvalid‚Äù in their name are audio clips that have had at least 2 people listen to them, and the majority of those listeners say the audio matches the text. The subsets with ‚Äúinvalid‚Äù in their name are clips that have had at least 2 listeners, and the majority say the audio does not match the clip. All other clips, ie. those with fewer than 2 votes, or those that have equal valid and invalid votes, have ‚Äúother‚Äù in their name.
The ‚Äúvalid‚Äù and ‚Äúother‚Äù subsets are further divided into 3 groups:
dev - for development and experimentation
train - for use in speech recognition training
test - for testing word error rate
Organization and Conventions
Each subset of data has a corresponding csv file with the following naming convention:
‚Äúcv-{type}-{group}.csv‚Äù
Here ‚Äútype‚Äù can be one of {valid, invalid, other}, and ‚Äúgroup‚Äù can be one of {dev, train, test}. Note, the invalid set is not divided into groups.
Each row of a csv file represents a single audio clip, and contains the following information:
filename - relative path of the audio file
text - supposed transcription of the audio
up_votes - number of people who said audio matches the text
down_votes - number of people who said audio does not match text
age - age of the speaker, if the speaker reported it
teens: '< 19'
twenties: '19 - 29'
thirties: '30 - 39'
fourties: '40 - 49'
fifties: '50 - 59'
sixties: '60 - 69'
seventies: '70 - 79'
eighties: '80 - 89'
nineties: '> 89'
gender - gender of the speaker, if the speaker reported it
male
female
other
accent - accent of the speaker, if the speaker reported it
us: 'United States English'
australia: 'Australian English'
england: 'England English'
canada: 'Canadian English'
philippines: 'Filipino'
hongkong: 'Hong Kong English'
indian: 'India and South Asia (India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka)'
ireland: 'Irish English'
malaysia: 'Malaysian English'
newzealand: 'New Zealand English'
scotland: 'Scottish English'
singapore: 'Singaporean English'
southatlandtic: 'South Atlantic (Falkland Islands, Saint Helena)'
african: 'Southern African (South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia)'
wales: 'Welsh English'
bermuda: 'West Indies and Bermuda (Bahamas, Bermuda, Jamaica, Trinidad)'
The audio clips for each subset are stored as mp3 files in folders with the same naming conventions as it‚Äôs corresponding csv file. So, for instance, all audio data from the valid train set will be kept in the folder ‚Äúcv-valid-train‚Äù alongside the ‚Äúcv-valid-train.csv‚Äù metadata file.

Sentiment analysis, the task of automatically detecting whether a piece of text is positive or negative, generally relies on a hand-curated list of words with positive sentiment (good, great, awesome) and negative sentiment (bad, gross, awful). This dataset contains both positive and negative sentiment lexicons for 81 languages.
Content:
The sentiment lexicons in this dataset were generated via graph propagation based on a knowledge graph--a graphical representation of real-world entities and the links between them. The general intuition is that words which are closely linked on a knowledge graph probably have similar sentiment polarities. For this project, sentiments were generated based on English sentiment lexicons.
This dataset contains sentiment lexicons for the following languages:

At the end of each year, Spotify compiles a playlist of the songs streamed most often over the course of that year. This year's playlist (Top Tracks of 2017) included 100 songs. The question is: What do these top songs have in common? Why do people like them?
Original Data Source: The audio features for each song were extracted using the Spotify Web API and the spotipy Python library. Credit goes to Spotify for calculating the audio feature values.
Data Description: There is one .csv file in the dataset. (featuresdf.csv) This file includes:
Spotify URI for the song
Name of the song
Artist(s) of the song
Audio features for the song (such as danceability, tempo, key etc.)
A more detailed explanation of the audio features can be found in the Metadata tab.
Exploring the Data: Some suggestions for what to do with the data:
Look for patterns in the audio features of the songs. Why do people stream these songs the most?
Try to predict one audio feature based on the others
See which features correlate the most"

This data set was made from an html rip made by reddit user ""usheep"" who threatened to expose all the vendors on Agora to the police if they did not meet his demands (sending him a small monetary amount ~few hundred dollars in exchange for him not leaking their info). Most information about what happened to ""usheep"" and his threats is nonexistent. He posted the html rip and was never heard from again. Agora shut down a few months after. It is unknown if this was related to ""usheep"" or not, but the raw html data remained.
Content
This is a data parse of marketplace data ripped from Agora (a dark/deep web) marketplace from the years 2014 to 2015. It contains drugs, weapons, books, services, and more. Duplicate listings have been removed and prices have been averaged of any duplicates. All of the data is in a csv file and has over 100,000 unique listings.
It is organized by:
Vendor: The seller
Category: Where in the marketplace the item falls under
Item: The title of the listing
Description: The description of the listing
Price: Cost of the item (averaged across any duplicate listings between 2014 and 2015)
Origin: Where the item is listed to have shipped from
Destination: Where the item is listed to be shipped to (blank means no information was provided, but mostly likely worldwide. I did not enter worldwide for any blanks however as to not make assumptions)
Rating: The rating of the seller (a rating of [0 deals] or anything else with ""deals"" in it means there is not concrete rating as the amount of deals is too small for a rating to be displayed)
Remarks: Only remark options are blank, or ""Average price may be skewed outliar > .5 BTC found"" which is pretty self explanatory.

Though I got this data from a 3rd party, it seems as though it originally came from here: https://www.gwern.net/DNM-archives Gwern Branwen seems to have complied all of his dark net marketplace leaks and html rips and has a multitude of possible uses for the data at the link above. It is free for anyone to use as long as proper credit is given to the creator. I would be happy to parse more data if anyone would like to request a specific website and/or format.
Inspiration
This data could be used to track drug dealers across different platforms. Potentially find correlations between different drugs and from where/to they ship in the world to show correlations between types of drugs and where drug dealers that supply them are located. Prices can estimate drug economies in certain regions of the world. Similar listings from 2 different vendors can perhaps point to competition to corner a market, or even show that some vendors may work together to corner a market. There are quite a few opportunities to do some really great stuff to find correlations between illegal drugs, weapons, and more in order to curb the flow of dark net drug trade by identifying high risk regions or vendors. I can potentially do a new parse of other websites so you can find correlations across websites rather than just within Agora."

I am a student exploring the possibility of making money in football betting. I am currently doing a literature review on modelling association football scores and trying to put together a machine learning system to use for my first betting campaign next season. What I have learned thus far is that outcomes of football events are partly deterministic and partly random. I do not know exactly how to go about implementing this in a machine learning system yet. I am also hoping to find useful features from this dataset.

This is a list of the finishers of the Boston Marathon of 2015, 2016 and 2017.
It's important to highlight that the Boston Marathon is the oldest marathon run in the US as it is the only marathon (other than olympic trails) that most of the participants have to qualify to participate.
For the professional runners, it's a big accomplishment to win the marathon. For most of the other participants, it's an honor to be part of it.
Content
It contains the name, age, gender, country, city and state (where available), times at 9 different stages of the race, expected time, finish time and pace, overall place, gender place and division place.
Decided to keep every year as a separate file, making it more manageable and easier to deal with it.
Acknowledgements
Data was scrapped from the official marathon website - http://registration.baa.org/2017/cf/Public/iframe_ResultsSearch.cfm
I have found that other people have done this kind of scraping, so, some of those ideas together with things I have learned in my quest to become a data scientist created the set.
You can actually find the scraping notebooks at - https://github.com/rojour/boston_results . Notebook it's not very clean yet, but I will get to it soon...
Inspiration
I was a participant in the marathon 2016 and 2017 edition, as well as a data science student, so it was a natural curiosity.
I have done a preliminary study of some fun facts. You can see the kernel here as well as in the github page listed above.
Already some people have created some fun analysis of the results (mostly of the first part - 2016) that was the first upload, but I am curious of what people may come up with... now that three years are available, it may spark the creative juices of some.
I believe it's a simple, fun dataset that can be used by the new to play with, and by some veterans to get creative."

Extraterrestrials, visitors, little green men, UFOs, swap gas. What do they want? Where do they come from? Do they like cheeseburgers? This dataset will likely not help you answer these questions. It does contain over 80,000 records of UFO sightings dating back as far as 1949. With the latitude and longitude data it is possible to assess the global distribution of UFO sightings (patterns could aid in planetary defence if invasion proves to be imminent). The dates and times, along with the duration of the UFO's stay and description of the craft also lend themselves to predictions. Can we find patterns in their arrival times and durations? Do aliens work on weekends? Help defend the planet and learn about your fellow earthlings (and when they are most likely to see ET).
Content
Date_time - standardized date and time of sighting
city - location of UFO sighting
state/province - the US state or Canadian province, appears blank for other locations
country - Country of UFO sighting
UFO_shape - a one word description of the ""spacecraft""
length_of_encounter_seconds - standardized to seconds, length of the observation of the UFO
described_duration _of_encounter - raw description of the length of the encounter (shows uncertainty to previous column)
description - text description of the UFO encounter. Warning column is messy, with some curation it could lend itself to some natural language processing and sentiment analysis.
date_documented - when was the UFO sighting reported
latitude - latitude
longitude - longitude
Note there are missing data in the columns. I've left it as is because depending on what the user is interested in the missing values in any one column may or may not matter.

Some great ways to use these data would be:
A global plot of the locations of recorded UFO sightings.
Can the duration of the UFO visit be predicted from the other data?
Is there a pattern to the appearances? At certain times of day, on certain days of the week or days of the year? (i.e. are people on their way home from the pub more likely to see little green men?)
Are certain shapes of UFO more likely to be seen in different geographical regions."

Is crime in America rising or falling? The answer is not as simple as politicians make it out to be because of how the FBI collects crime data from the country‚Äôs more than 18,000 police agencies. National estimates can be inconsistent and out of date, as the FBI takes months or years to piece together reports from those agencies that choose to participate in the voluntary program.
To try to fill this gap, The Marshall Project collected and analyzed more than 40 years of data on the four major crimes the FBI classifies as violent ‚Äî homicide, rape, robbery and assault ‚Äî in 68 police jurisdictions with populations of 250,000 or greater. We obtained 2015 reports, which have yet to be released by the FBI, directly from 61 of them. We calculated the rate of crime in each category and for all violent crime, per 100,000 residents in the jurisdiction, based on the FBI‚Äôs estimated population for that year. We used the 2014 estimated population to calculate 2015 crime rates per capita.
Acknowledgements
The crime data was acquired from the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting program's ""Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest"" database for the year in question, held at the National Archives of Criminal Justice Data. The data was compiled and analyzed by Gabriel Dance, Tom Meagher, and Emily Hopkins of The Marshall Project; the analysis was published as Crime in Context on 18 August 2016."

Bible (or Biblia in Greek) is a collection of sacred texts or scriptures that Jews and Christians consider to be a product of divine inspiration and a record of the relationship between God and humans (Wiki). And for data mining purpose, we could do many things using Bible scriptures as for NLP, Classification, Sentiment Analysis and other particular topics between Data Science and Theology perspective.

Bible in Basic English (BBE)
Darby English Bible (DARBY)
King James Version (KJV)
Webster's Bible (WBT)
World English Bible (WEB)
Young's Literal Translation (YLT)
Each verse is accessed by a unique key, the combination of the BOOK+CHAPTER+VERSE id.
Example:
Genesis 1:1 (Genesis chapter 1, verse 1) = 01001001 (01 001 001)
Exodus 2:3 (Exodus chapter 2, verse 3) = 02002003 (02 002 003)
The verse-id system is used for faster, simplified queries.
For instance: 01001001 - 02001005 would capture all verses between Genesis 1:1 through Exodus 1:5.
Written simply:
SELECT * FROM bible.t_asv WHERE id BETWEEN 01001001 AND 02001005

These tables work together providing you a great basis for a bible-reading and cross-referencing app. In addition, each book is marked with a particular genre, mapping in the number-to-genre key (key_genre_english table) and common abbreviations for each book can be looked up in the abbreviations list (key_abbreviations_english table). While its expected that your programs would use the verse-id system, book #, chapter #, and verse # columns have been included in the bible versions tables.
A Valuable Cross-Reference Table
A very special and valuable addition to these databases is the extensive cross-reference table. It was created from the project at http://www.openbible.info/labs/cross-references/. See .txt version included from http://www.openbible.info website. Its extremely useful in bible study for discovering related scriptures. For any given verse, you simply query vid (verse id), and a list of rows will be returned. Each of those rows has a rank (r) for relevance, start-verse (sv), and end verse (ev) if there is one.
Basic Web Interaction
The web folder contains two php files. Edit the first few lines of index.php to match your server's settings. Place these in a folder on your webserver. The references search box can be multiple comma separated values. (i.e. John 3:16, Rom 3:23, 1 Jn 1:9, Romans 10:9-10) You can also directly link to a verse by altering the URI: [http://localhost/index.php?b=John 3:16, Rom 3:23, 1 Jn 1:9, Romans 10:9-10](http://localhost/index.php?b=John 3:16, Rom 3:23, 1 Jn 1:9, Romans 10:9-10)
bible-mysql.sql (MySQL) is the main database and most feature-oriented due to contributions from developers. It is suggested you use that for most things, or at least convert the information from it.
cross_references-mysql.sql (MySQL) is the cross-reference table. It has been separated to become an optional feature. This is converted from the project at http://www.openbible.info/labs/cross-references/.
bible-sqlite.db (SQLite) is a basic simplified database for simpler applications (includes cross-references too).
cross_references.txt is the source cross-reference file obtained from http://www.openbible.info/labs/cross-references/
In CSV folder, you will find (same list order with the other formats):
bible_version_key.csv
key_abbreviations_english.csv
key_english.csv
key_genre_english.csv
t_asv.csv, t_bbe.csv, t_dby.csv, t_wbt.csv, t_web.csv, t_ylt.csv

The Data
Originally, this dataset was broken into two parts: the training set and the evaluation set. As this was a competition, the responses to the evaluation set were not given as part of the original release; they were, however, released after the end of the competition in a separate file. This dataset contains all three of these files, combined into one.
The field ORIGIN in the caravan-insurance-challenge.csv file has the values train and test, corresponding to the training and evaluation sets, respectively. To simulate the original challenge, you can ignore the test rows, and test your model's prediction on those observations once you've trained only on the training set.
Each observation corresponds to a postal code. Variables beginning with M refer to demographic statistics of the postal code, while variables beginning with P and A (as well as CARAVAN, the target variable) refer to product ownership and insurance statistics in the postal code.

The Human Development Index (HDI) is a summary measure of achievements in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, access to knowledge, and a decent standard of living. The HDI is the geometric mean of normalized indices for each of the three dimensions. The health dimension is assessed by life expectancy at birth, the education dimension is measured by mean of years of education for adults aged 25 years and more and expected years of education for children, and the standard of living dimension is measured by gross national income per capita. The Inequality-Adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) adjusts the HDI for inequality in the distribution of each dimension across the population.
The Gender Development Index (GDI) measures gender inequalities in achievement in three basic dimensions of human development: health, measured by female and male life expectancy at birth; education, measured by female and male expected years of education for children and female and male mean years of education for adults ages 25 and older; and command over economic resources, measured by female and male estimated earned income. The Gender Inequality Index (GII) reflects gender-based disadvantage in three dimensions‚Äîreproductive health, empowerment, and the labour market‚Äîfor as many countries as data of reasonable quality allow. It shows the loss in potential human development due to inequality between female and male achievements in these dimensions.
The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) identifies multiple deprivations at the household level in education, health, and standard of living as indicators of poverty. It uses micro data from household surveys, and ‚Äî unlike the IHDI ‚Äî all the indicators needed to construct the measure must come from the same survey."
2016 Global Ecological Footprint,Does your country consume more resources than it produces in a year?,Global Footprint Network,25,"Version 1,2017-03-02",ecology,CSV,22 KB,CC4,"5,878 views",704 downloads,8 kernels,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/footprintnetwork/ecological-footprint,"Context
The ecological footprint measures the ecological assets that a given population requires to produce the natural resources it consumes (including plant-based food and fiber products, livestock and fish products, timber and other forest products, space for urban infrastructure) and to absorb its waste, especially carbon emissions. The footprint tracks the use of six categories of productive surface areas: cropland, grazing land, fishing grounds, built-up (or urban) land, forest area, and carbon demand on land.
A nation‚Äôs biocapacity represents the productivity of its ecological assets, including cropland, grazing land, forest land, fishing grounds, and built-up land. These areas, especially if left unharvested, can also absorb much of the waste we generate, especially our carbon emissions.
Both the ecological footprint and biocapacity are expressed in global hectares ‚Äî globally comparable, standardized hectares with world average productivity.
If a population‚Äôs ecological footprint exceeds the region‚Äôs biocapacity, that region runs an ecological deficit. Its demand for the goods and services that its land and seas can provide ‚Äî fruits and vegetables, meat, fish, wood, cotton for clothing, and carbon dioxide absorption ‚Äî exceeds what the region‚Äôs ecosystems can renew. A region in ecological deficit meets demand by importing, liquidating its own ecological assets (such as overfishing), and/or emitting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. If a region‚Äôs biocapacity exceeds its ecological footprint, it has an ecological reserve.
Acknowledgements
The ecological footprint measure was conceived by Mathis Wackernagel and William Rees at the University of British Columbia. Ecological footprint data was provided by the Global Footprint Network.
Inspiration
Is your country running an ecological deficit, consuming more resources than it can produce per year? Which countries have the greatest ecological deficits or reserves? Do they consume less or produce more than the average country? When will Earth Overshoot Day, the day on the calendar when humanity has used one year of natural resources, occur in 2017?"

Favicons are the (usually tiny) image files that browsers may use to represent websites in tabs, in the URL bar, or for bookmarks. Kaggle, for example, uses an image of a blue lowercase ""k"" as its favicon. This dataset contains about 360,000 favicons from popular websites.
Content and Acknowledgements
These favicons were scraped in July 2016. I wrote a crawler that went through Alexa's top 1 million sites, and made a request for 'favicon.ico' at the site root. If I got a 200 response code, I saved the result as ${site_url}.ico. For domains that were identical but for the TLD (e.g. google.com, google.ca, google.jp...), I scraped only one favicon. My scraping/cleaning code is on GitHub here.
Of 1m sites crawled, 540k responded with a 200 code. The dataset has 360k images, which were the remains after filtering out:
empty files (-140k)
non-image files, according to the file command (-40k). These mostly had type HTML, ASCII, or UTF-*.
corrupt/malformed image files - i.e. those that were sufficiently messed up that ImageMagick failed to parse them. (-1k)
The remaining files are exactly as I received them from the site. They are mostly ICO files, with the most common sizes being 16x16, 32x32, and 48x48. But there's a long tail of more exotic formats and sizes (there is at least one person living among us who thought that 88x31 was a fine size for a favicon).
The favicon files are divided among 6 zip files, full-0.zip, full-1.zip... full-5.zip. (If you wish to download the full dataset as a single tarball, you can do so from the Internet Archive)
favicon_metadata.csv is a csv file with one row per favicon in the dataset. The split_index says which of the zip files the image landed in. For an example of loading and interacting with particular favicons in a kernel context, check out the Favicon helper functions kernel.
As mentioned above, the full dataset is a dog's breakfast of different file formats and dimensions. I've created 'standardized' subsets of the data that may be easier to work with (particularly for machine learning applications, where it's necessary to have fixed dimensions).
16_16.tar.gz is a tarball containing all 16x16 favicons in the dataset, converted to PNG. It has 290k images. ICO is a container format, and many of the ico files in the raw dataset contain several versions of the same favicon at different resolutions. 16x16 favicons that were stuffed together in an ICO file with images of other sizes are included in this set. But I did no resizing - if a favicon has no 'native' 16x16 version, it isn't in this set.
16_16_distinct.tar.gz is identical to the above, but with 70k duplicate or near-duplicate images removed. There are a small number of commonly repeated favicons like the Blogger ""B"" that occur thousands of times, which could be an annoyance depending on the use case - e.g. a generative model might get stuck in a local maximum of spitting out Blogger Bs.
Alexa's top 1-million list includes 'adult' sites, so some URLs and favicons may be NSFW or offensive. (It's pretty hard to make a credible depiction of nudity in 256 pixels, but there are some occasional attempts.)
Inspiration
I hope this dataset might be especially useful for small-scale deep learning experiments. Scaling photographs down to 16x16 would render many of them unintelligible, but these favicons were born tiny. The 16_16 fold has more instances than MNIST, and the images are even smaller! (Though, unlike MNIST, most of the images in this dataset are not grayscale.)
If you liked this, you should also check out the recently released Large Logo Dataset. They've currently made available 550k favicons resized to 32x32. Their data was collected more recently, and their scraping process was more robust, so their dataset should probably be preferred (though you might still want to use this one if you need the raw favicon files, or if you prefer to use 16x16 non-resized images)."

On the morning of 10 January 2017, Opplysningsr√•det for Veitrafikken (OFV), Norwegian road association, held a business breakfast for its member organizations, where they presented the annual presentation under the title ""Car Year 2016. Status and trends"" (Bil√•ret 2016 ‚Äì status og trender). Among the highlights for the year, OFV reported all-time-high sales of electric cars, with fully electric and plug-in hybrid cars accounting for 40,2% of all new car sales (compare to 7.4% for Sweden and 3.6% for Denmark). No other country in the world has this level of popularity of battery-equipped vehicles! In November 2016, 12 out of 15 most popular cars sold in Norway were either hybrids of fully electric vehicles with BWM-i3 snapping the title as the most popular car in Norway, ahead of undisputed leader of the last decade VW Golf (including eGolf), according to bilnorge.no. Among 10 most popular cars for the year, OFV reported, there was only one(!) fossil fuel vehicle.

Taking into account the actual monthly figures for the last four years
Actual same-month sales for the previous year is combined with the average for the eight previous months, weighed by the month's proportion in a year, adjusted by year's actual sales compared with those of the last year.
OFV forecast for 2016 was 157 500 new passenger cars. Actual sales were 154 603 cars. Applying the same model for 2017, OFV forecasts 152 400 new passenger cars to be sold in Norway.

health",CSV,611 KB,Other,"8,518 views",843 downloads,12 kernels,2 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/pitasr/falldata,"Falls among the elderly is an important health issue. Fall detection and movement tracking are therefore instrumental in addressing this issue. This paper responds to the challenge of classifying different movements as a part of a system designed to fulfill the need for a wearable device to collect data for fall and near-fall analysis. Four different fall trajectories (forward, backward, left and right), three normal activities (standing, walking and lying down) and near-fall situations are identified and detected.
Falls are a serious public health problem and possibly life threatening for people in fall risk groups. We develop an automated fall detection system with wearable motion sensor units fitted to the subjects‚Äô body at six different positions. Each unit comprises three tri-axial devices (accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer/compass). Fourteen volunteers perform a standardized set of movements including 20 voluntary falls and 16 activities of daily living (ADLs), resulting in a large dataset with 2520 trials. To reduce the computational complexity of training and testing the classifiers, we focus on the raw data for each sensor in a 4 s time window around the point of peak total acceleration of the waist sensor, and then perform feature extraction and reduction.
We successfully distinguish falls from ADLs using six machine learning techniques (classifiers): the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier, least squares method (LSM), support vector machines (SVM), Bayesian decision making (BDM), dynamic time warping (DTW), and artificial neural networks (ANNs). We compare the performance and the computational complexity of the classifiers and achieve the best results with the k-NN classifier and LSM, with sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy all above 95%. These classifiers also have acceptable computational requirements for training and testing. Our approach would be applicable in real-world scenarios where data records of indeterminate length, containing multiple activities in sequence, are recorded.

1) Data Background
In the Data Mining class, we had the opportunity to analyze data by performing data mining algorithms to a dataset. Our dataset is from Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC). OFLC is a division of the U.S. Department of Labor. The main duty of OFLC is to assist the Secretary of Labor to enforce part of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which requires certain labor conditions exist before employers can hire foreign workers. H-1B is a visa category in the United States of America under the INA, section 101(a)(15)(H) which allows U.S. employers to employ foreign workers. The first step employer must take to hire a foreign worker is to file the Labor Condition Application. In this project, we will analyze the data from the Labor Condition Application.
1.1) Introduction to H1B Dataset
The H-1B Dataset selected for this project contains data from employer‚Äôs Labor Condition Application and the case certification determinations processed by the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) where the date of the determination was issues on or after October 1, 2016 and on or before June 30, 2017.
The Labor Condition Application (LCA) is a document that a perspective H-1B employer files with U.S. Department of Labor Employment and Training Administration (DOLETA) when it seeks to employ non-immigrant workers at a specific job occupation in an area of intended employment for not more than three years.
1.2) Goal of the Project
Our goal for this project is to predict the case status of an application submitted by the employer to hire non-immigrant workers under the H-1B visa program. Employer can hire non-immigrant workers only after their LCA petition is approved. The approved LCA petition is then submitted as part of the Petition for a Non-immigrant Worker application for work authorizations for H-1B visa status.
We want to uncover insights that can help employers understand the process of getting their LCA approved. We will use WEKA software to run data mining algorithms to understand the relationship between attributes and the target variable.

Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) is the most common subtype of all breast cancers. To assign an aggressiveness grade to a whole mount sample, pathologists typically focus on the regions which contain the IDC. As a result, one of the common pre-processing steps for automatic aggressiveness grading is to delineate the exact regions of IDC inside of a whole mount slide.
Content
The original dataset consisted of 162 whole mount slide images of Breast Cancer (BCa) specimens scanned at 40x. From that, 277,524 patches of size 50 x 50 were extracted (198,738 IDC negative and 78,786 IDC positive). Each patch‚Äôs file name is of the format: u_xX_yY_classC.png ‚Äî > example 10253_idx5_x1351_y1101_class0.png . Where u is the patient ID (10253_idx5), X is the x-coordinate of where this patch was cropped from, Y is the y-coordinate of where this patch was cropped from, and C indicates the class where 0 is non-IDC and 1 is IDC.

The United States census count (also known as the Decennial Census of Population and Housing) is a count of every resident of the US. The census occurs every 10 years and is conducted by the United States Census Bureau. Census data is publicly available through the census website, but much of the data is available in summarized data and graphs. The raw data is often difficult to obtain, is typically divided by region, and it must be processed and combined to provide information about the nation as a whole. The United States census dataset includes nationwide population counts from the 2000 and 2010 censuses. Data is broken out by gender, age and location using zip code tabular areas (ZCTAs) and GEOIDs. ZCTAs are generalized representations of zip codes, and often, though not always, are the same as the zip code for an area. GEOIDs are numeric codes that uniquely identify all administrative, legal, and statistical geographic areas for which the Census Bureau tabulates data. GEOIDs are useful for correlating census data with other censuses and surveys.

An asteroid's orbit is computed by finding the elliptical path about the sun that best fits the available observations of the object. That is, the object's computed path about the sun is adjusted until the predictions of where the asteroid should have appeared in the sky at several observed times match the positions where the object was actually observed to be at those same times. As more and more observations are used to further improve an object's orbit, we become more and more confident in our knowledge of where the object will be in the future.
When the discovery of a new near Earth asteroid is announced by the Minor Planet Center, Sentry automatically prioritizes the object for an impact risk analysis. If the prioritization analysis indicates that the asteroid cannot pass near the Earth or that its orbit is very well determined, the computationally intensive nonlinear search for potential impacts is not pursued. If, on the other hand, a search is deemed necessary then the object is added to a queue of objects awaiting analysis. Its position in the queue is determined by the estimated likelihood that potential impacts may be found.

For continuous monitors, it can represent an averaging time of many samples (for example, a 1-hour value may be the average of four one-minute samples collected during each quarter of the hour).
Pollutant Standard:A description of the ambient air quality standard rules used to aggregate statistics. (See description at beginning of document.)
Metric Used: The base metric used in the calculation of the aggregate statistics presented in the remainder of the row. For example, if this is Daily Maximum, then the value in the Mean column is the mean of the daily maximums.
Method Name: A short description of the processes, equipment, and protocols used in gathering and measuring the sample.
Year: The year the annual summary data represents.
Units of Measure: The unit of measure for the parameter. QAD always returns data in the standard units for the parameter. Submitters are allowed to report data in any unit and EPA converts to a standard unit so that we may use the data in calculations.
Event Type: Indicates whether data measured during exceptional events are included in the summary. A wildfire is an example of an exceptional event; it is something that affects air quality, but the local agency has no control over. No Events means no events occurred. Events Included means events occurred and the data from them is included in the summary. Events Excluded means that events occurred but data form them is excluded from the summary. Concurred Events Excluded means that events occurred but only EPA concurred exclusions are removed from the summary. If an event occurred for the parameter in question, the data will have multiple records for each monitor.
Observation Count: The number of observations (samples) taken during the year.
Observation Percent: The percent representing the number of observations taken with respect to the number scheduled to be taken during the year. This is only calculated for monitors where measurements are required (e.g., only certain parameters).
Completeness Indicator: An indication of whether the regulatory data completeness criteria for valid summary data have been met by the monitor for the year. Y means yes, N means no or that there are no regulatory completeness criteria for the parameter.
Valid Day Count: The number of days during the year where the daily monitoring criteria were met, if the calculation of the summaries is based on valid days.
Required Day Count: The number of days during the year which the monitor was scheduled to take samples if measurements are required.
Exceptional Data Count: The number of data points in the annual data set affected by exceptional air quality events (things outside the norm that affect air quality).
Null Data Count: The count of scheduled samples when no data was collected and the reason for no data was reported.
Primary Exceedance Count: The number of samples during the year that exceeded the primary air quality standard.
Secondary Exceedance Count: The number of samples during the year that exceeded the secondary air quality standard.
Certification Indicator: An indication whether the completeness and accuracy of the information on the annual summary record has been certified by the submitter. Certified means the submitter has certified the data (due May 01 the year after collection). Certification not required means that the parameter does not require certification or the deadline has not yet passed. Uncertified (past due) means that certification is required but is overdue. Requested but not yet concurred means the submitter has completed the process, but EPA has not yet acted to certify the data. Requested but denied means the submitter has completed the process, but EPA has denied the request for cause. Was certified but data changed means the data was certified but data was replaced and the process has not been repeated.
Num Obs Below MDL: The number of samples reported during the year that were below the method detection limit (MDL) for the monitoring instrument. Sometimes these values are replaced by 1/2 the MDL in summary calculations.
Arithmetic Mean: The average (arithmetic mean) value for the year.
Arithmetic Standard Dev: The standard deviation about the mean of the values for the year.
1st Max Value: The highest value for the year.
1st Max DateTime: The date and time (on a 24-hour clock) when the highest value for the year (the previous field) was taken.
2nd Max Value: The second highest value for the year.
2nd Max DateTime: The date and time (on a 24-hour clock) when the second highest value for the year (the previous field) was taken.
3rd Max Value: The third highest value for the year.
3rd Max DateTime: The date and time (on a 24-hour clock) when the third highest value for the year (the previous field) was taken.
4th Max Value: The fourth highest value for the year.
4th Max DateTime: The date and time (on a 24-hour clock) when the fourth highest value for the year (the previous field) was taken.
1st Max Non Overlapping Value: For 8-hour CO averages, the highest value of the year.
1st NO Max DateTime: The date and time (on a 24-hour clock) when the first maximum non overlapping value for the year (the previous field) was taken.
2nd Max Non Overlapping Value: For 8-hour CO averages, the second highest value of the year that does not share any hours with the 8-hour period of the first max non overlapping value.
2nd NO Max DateTime: The date and time (on a 24-hour clock) when the second maximum non overlapping value for the year (the previous field) was taken.
99th Percentile: The value from this monitor for which 99 per cent of the rest of the measured values for the year are equal to or less than.
98th Percentile: The value from this monitor for which 98 per cent of the rest of the measured values for the year are equal to or less than.

An adversarial example is a sample of input data which has been modified very slightly in a way that is intended to cause a machine learning classifier to misclassify it. In many cases, these modifications can be so subtle that a human observer does not even notice the modification at all, yet the classifier still makes a mistake.
Adversarial examples pose security concerns because they could be used to perform an attack on machine learning systems, even if the adversary has no access to the underlying model.
To accelerate research on adversarial examples, Google Brain is organizing Competition on Adversarial Examples and Defenses within the NIPS 2017 competition track. This dataset contains the development images for this competition.
The competition on Adversarial Examples and Defenses consist of three sub-competitions:
Non-targeted Adversarial Attack. The goal of the non-targeted attack is to slightly modify source image in a way that image will be classified incorrectly by generally unknown machine learning classifier.
Targeted Adversarial Attack. The goal of the targeted attack is to slightly modify source image in a way that image will be classified as specified target class by generally unknown machine learning classifier.
Defense Against Adversarial Attack. The goal of the defense is to build machine learning classifier which is robust to adversarial example, i.e. can classify adversarial images correctly.
In each of the sub-competitions you're invited to make and submit a program which solves the corresponding task. In the end of the competition we will run all attacks against all defenses to evaluate how each of the attacks performs against each of the defenses."

EEG data from basic sensory task in Schizophrenia,Button press and auditory tone event related potentials from 81 human subjects,Brian Roach,24,"Version 3,2017-11-17|Version 2,2017-11-11|Version 1,2017-11-11","mental health

neuroscience",CSV,2 GB,CC4,"3,385 views",237 downloads,2 kernels,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/broach/button-tone-sz,"Context
Humans (and many other animals) have the ability to reduce or suppress their brains' responses to sensory consequences that are a result of their own actions. The nervous system accomplishes this with a corollary discharge forward model system in which an ""efference copy"" of an impending motor plan is transmitted from motor to sensory cortex where it generates a ""corollary discharge"" representation of the expected sensory consequences of the imminent motor act. For example, when you move your eyes from left to right, your brain knows the environment is not shifting. When you speak, your auditory cortex has a reduced response to the expected sound of your voice.
Schizophrenia is a chronic mental illness that affects about 1% of people across the globe. One possible explanation for some of the symptoms of schizophrenia is that one or more problems with the corollary discharge process in the nervous system makes it difficult for patients to differentiate between internally and externally generated stimuli. Therefore, studying this process and its relationship to symptoms in the illness might allow us to better understand abnormal brain processes in patients with this diagnosis.
In a previously published EEG experiment (full report), we used a simple button pressing task in which subjects either (1) pressed a button to immediately generated a tone, (2) passively listened to the same tone, or (3) pressed a button without generating a tone to study the corollary discharge in people with schizophrenia and comparison controls. We found that comparison controls suppressed the N100, a negative deflection in EEG brain wave 100 milliseconds after the onset of a sound, when they pressed a button to generate a tone compared to passive playback, but patients with schizophrenia did not. This data set is a larger sample replication of that previous study. Specifically, EEG data from 22 controls and 36 patients with schizophrenia have been combined with 10 controls and 13 patients from the previous report.
Methods
Due to the size of the raw EEG data, some pre-processing was done prior to upload. EEG data acquisition parameters and the experimental task was identical to that described in our paper. However, pre-processing differed. All individual subject data had at least the following data processing steps applied, in this order:
Re-reference to averaged ear lobes
0.1 Hz high-pass filter
Interpolation of outlier channels in the continuous EEG data (outliers defined as in this paper)
Chop continous data into single trial epochs 1.5 seconds before and after task events (3s total)
Baseline correction -100 to 0ms
Canonical correlation analysis to remove muscle and high-frequency white noise artifacts
Rejection of outlier single trials (outliers defined as in this paper)
Removal of outlier components from a spatial independent components analysis (outliers defined as in this paper)
Interpolation of outlier channels within single trials (outliers defined as in this paper)
Derived data includes event-related potential (ERP) averages for 9 electrode sites analyzed in our previous report, including Fz, FCz, Cz, FC3, FC4, C3, C4, CP3, CP4 (pictured below):
The ERPs are calculated by averaging across trials for every sample in the time series, separately for each subject, electrode, and condition.
Content
The single trial data from all 64 channels are too large to be uploaded for all 81 subjects, but those interested in that type of data will find one subject (subject 21 in 21.csv) among the data files. This includes all his data after the pre-processing step 9 listed above.
For those interested in comparing patients with schizophrenia to control subjects, the ERPdata.csv file contains the averaged, ERP time series for all subjects, conditions, and the 9 electrodes mentioned above. These data, along with the subject information in demographic.csv could be used to replicate the analyses in our prior report.
For those interested in single trial categorization/prediction like the grasp-and-lift challenge or the face decoding challenge, the mergedTrialData.csv contains summary measurements from nearly 24,000 individual trials (all subjects and conditions are included).

Metal-Archives.com (MA for short) is an encyclopedia website which includes information of nearly all heavy bands and albums on the earth. This information is collected and submitted by metalheads from all around the world. This dataset includes all ""death metal"" bands and albums on MA (by Nov. 2016). It's the search result by genre key word ""death metal"" which includes all bands which contain phrase ""death metal"" in their genre. (e.g. ""technical death metal"", ""brutal death metal"", ""melodic death metal"" ... )
The banner of dataset is the cover art of New Jersey-based death metal band Disma's debut full-length album ""Towards the Megalith"" (2011, Profound Lore Records). It's beautiful but not quite typical for this dataset's theme. But 1900+ resolution picture about death metal is rare, so I've chosen this one.

multiclass classification",Other,391 MB,CC4,"5,972 views",568 downloads,7 kernels,6 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/lgmoneda/br-coins,"Context
These datasets were created for a college course work. It was an opportunity to test Deep Learning capabilities for computer vision in a very restricted problem.
The idea is to explore a classification problem for a single coin and a regression problem for a group of coins, trying to count how much money they sum. You can see my initial approach here.
Content
There are two datasets. One for classification and another for regression. The first contains 3000 images with just a single coin in it. The second contains the first one and another 3000 images with two or more coins present in each example.
In the classification problem there are five classes: 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 cents. For regression, there are examples from 5 to 175 cents.
Every file contains its value in money as its filename. For example: 5_1477146780.jpg contains a single 5 cents coin. If there's only one coin, it's the coin value itself. In the 80_1477851090.jpg you're going to find enough coins to sum 80 cents. An example (90_1477854720.jpg):
Different coins from each type were used to make it more interesting. My fingers appear in some images!
I tried to keep the distance, illumination and background constant for all of them, but some differences will be noticed, specially in the illumination. Changing the coin position has an great impact in how the light reflects over it. The structure used to take the pictures (in fact, a second light source was added):
Inspiration
A model that can sum coins and tell how much money we have in a group of coins could be used for people with vision disabilities. Can Deep Learning count, classify and sum in a single model? Should we split the problem into segmentation, classification and then sum it? What can be done with this amount of data? Can we achieve a good generalization and predict sums beyond the dataset greatest value?

Context
The Severe Weather Data Inventory (SWDI) is an integrated database of severe weather records for the United States. Severe weather is a phenomenon that risks the physical well-being of people and property. In fact, the frozen precipitation resulting from fast updrafts during strong thunderstorms can lead to serious damage and harm. Each year, the U.S. sees approximately $1 billion in property and crop damage due to severe weather incidents.
Frequency: Event-level
Period: 2015
Content
The records in SWDI come from a variety of sources in the National Climatic Data Center archive and cover a number of weather phenomena. This extract from 2015 covers hail detections including the probability of a weather event as well as the size and severity of hail -- all of which help understand potential damage to property and injury to people. Records are event-level records. Individual storm cells with a high probability of yielding hail are included in this dataset -- a total of n = 10,824,080.

Think about the geospatial and spatial statistical techniques that can be applied to this data to uncover patterns in storms.
How often does serious severe weather happen?
Where do these severe weather events normally occur?
What correlations exist between severe weather and other environmental phenomena?

SWDI provides a uniform way to access data from a variety of sources, but it does not provide any additional quality control beyond the processing which took place when the data were archived. The data sources in SWDI will not provide complete severe weather coverage of a geographic region or time period, due to a number of factors (eg, reports for a location or time period not provided to NOAA). The absence of SWDI data for a particular location and time should not be interpreted as an indication that no severe weather occurred at that time and location. Furthermore, much of the data in SWDI is automatically derived from radar data and represents probable conditions for an event, rather than a confirmed occurrence.

Each day, Backblaze takes a snapshot of each operational hard drive that includes basic hard drive information (e.g., capacity, failure) and S.M.A.R.T. statistics reported by each drive. This dataset contains data from the first two quarters in 2016.
Content
This dataset contains basic hard drive information and 90 columns or raw and normalized values of 45 different S.M.A.R.T. statistics. Each row represents a daily snapshot of one hard drive.
date: Date in yyyy-mm-dd format
serial_number: Manufacturer-assigned serial number of the drive

capacity_bytes: Drive capacity in bytes
failure: Contains a ‚Äú0‚Äù if the drive is OK. Contains a ‚Äú1‚Äù if this is the last day the drive was operational before failing.
90 variables that begin with 'smart': Raw and Normalized values for 45 different SMART stats as reported by the given drive
Inspiration
Some items to keep in mind as you process the data:
S.M.A.R.T. statistic can vary in meaning based on the manufacturer and model. It may be more informative to compare drives that are similar in model and manufacturer
Some S.M.A.R.T. columns can have out-of-bound values
When a drive fails, the 'failure' column is set to 1 on the day of failure, and starting the day after, the drive will be removed from the dataset. Each day, new drives are also added. This means that total number of drives each day may vary.
S.M.A.R.T. 9 is the number of hours a drive has been in service. To calculate a drive's age in days, divide this number by 24.
Given the hints above, below are a couple of questions to help you explore the dataset:
What is the median survival time of a hard drive? How does this differ by model/manufacturer?
Can you calculate the probability that a hard drive will fail given the hard drive information and statistics in the dataset?

Marvel Comics, originally called Timely Comics Inc., has been publishing comic books for several decades. ""The Golden Age of Comics"" name that was given due to the popularity of the books during the first years, was later followed by a period of decline of interest in superhero stories due to World War ref. In 1961, Marvel relaunched its superhero comic books publishing line. This new era started what has been known as the Marvel Age of Comics. Characters created during this period such as Spider-Man, the Hulk, the Fantastic Four, and the X-Men, together with those created during the Golden Age such as Captain America, are known worldwide and have become cultural icons during the last decades. Later, Marvel's characters popularity has been revitalized even more due to the release of several recent movies which recreate the comic books using spectacular modern special effects. Nowadays, it is possible to access the content of the comic books via a digital platform created by Marvel, where it is possible to subscribe monthly or yearly to get access to the comics. More information about the Marvel Universe can be found here.
Content
The dataset contains heroes and comics, and the relationship between them. The dataset is divided into three files:
nodes.csv: Contains two columns (node, type), indicating the name and the type (comic, hero) of the nodes.
edges.csv: Contains two columns (hero, comic), indicating in which comics the heroes appear.
hero-edge.csv: Contains the network of heroes which appear together in the comics. This file was originally taken from http://syntagmatic.github.io/exposedata/marvel/

Sign Language MNIST,Drop-In Replacement for MNIST for Hand Gesture Recognition Tasks,tecperson,23,"Version 1,2017-10-20","languages
healthcare
linguistics",Other,101 MB,CC0,"2,853 views",430 downloads,5 kernels,2 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist,"The original MNIST image dataset of handwritten digits is a popular benchmark for image-based machine learning methods but researchers have renewed efforts to update it and develop drop-in replacements that are more challenging for computer vision and original for real-world applications. As noted in one recent replacement called the Fashion-MNIST dataset, the Zalando researchers quoted the startling claim that ""Most pairs of MNIST digits (784 total pixels per sample) can be distinguished pretty well by just one pixel"". To stimulate the community to develop more drop-in replacements, the Sign Language MNIST is presented here and follows the same CSV format with labels and pixel values in single rows. The American Sign Language letter database of hand gestures represent a multi-class problem with 24 classes of letters (excluding J and Z which require motion).
The dataset format is patterned to match closely with the classic MNIST. Each training and test case represents a label (0-25) as a one-to-one map for each alphabetic letter A-Z (and no cases for 9=J or 25=Z because of gesture motions). The training data (27,455 cases) and test data (7172 cases) are approximately half the size of the standard MNIST but otherwise similar with a header row of label, pixel1,pixel2....pixel784 which represent a single 28x28 pixel image with grayscale values between 0-255. The original hand gesture image data represented multiple users repeating the gesture against different backgrounds. The Sign Language MNIST data came from greatly extending the small number (1704) of the color images included as not cropped around the hand region of interest. To create new data, an image pipeline was used based on ImageMagick and included cropping to hands-only, gray-scaling, resizing, and then creating at least 50+ variations to enlarge the quantity. The modification and expansion strategy was filters ('Mitchell', 'Robidoux', 'Catrom', 'Spline', 'Hermite'), along with 5% random pixelation, +/- 15% brightness/contrast, and finally 3 degrees rotation. Because of the tiny size of the images, these modifications effectively alter the resolution and class separation in interesting, controllable ways.
This dataset was inspired by the Fashion-MNIST 2 and the machine learning pipeline for gestures by Sreehari 4.
A robust visual recognition algorithm could provide not only new benchmarks that challenge modern machine learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Nets but also could pragmatically help the deaf and hard-of-hearing better communicate using computer vision applications. The National Institute on Deafness and other Communications Disorders (NIDCD) indicates that the 200-year-old American Sign Language is a complete, complex language (of which letter gestures are only part) but is the primary language for many deaf North Americans. ASL is the leading minority language in the U.S. after the ""big four"": Spanish, Italian, German, and French. One could implement computer vision in an inexpensive board computer like Raspberry Pi with OpenCV, and some Text-to-Speech to enabling improved and automated translation applications."

There has been increased interest among the public about the Environment and living conditions in India. Especially, after since many manufacturing units are being planned, people are worried about how it will affect the underground water quality and the environment. Government of India, under the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation has released the Water Quality Affected Data for 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. The objective here is to analyze this data alongside with Forest, Industries, Habitation, and development projects data in the same area (panchayat) to figure out whether there is any connection between the development effort and the quality of water getting affected. This effort will identify such associations and create awareness such that people and the Govt. can act in time to avoid further deterioration of the water resources.
Content:
Currently, there is this data set of areas with affected water quality for the years 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. Further datasets are expected for subsequent years. These datasets identify the state, district and specific localities in which water quality degradation has been reported in that particular year. Focus should be on the area (Panchayat/Village) rather than the district or the state as a whole, and observations should be made if there are any associations between the other sets of data available for the same area (from industrial, habitation, manufacturing and other sources, which I intend to add here also).
Acknowledgements:
My deep gratitude to the Government of India for making this data available through the Open Data initiative.
Inspiration:
Let's explore if there are any repetitive patterns of water quality degradation in the same area for multiple years.
As a whole, which areas in India has a lot of water quality degradation issues over the years (heat maps)
Which chemical is predominantly present in most of the water quality issues (heat maps). And why (from the associations with other developmental data like industry, manufacturing, development initiatives, housing, habitation, etc.)
As a whole, for the country, is the water quality degrading or upgrading (number of instances reported of water quality getting affected)?
Let's explore if there are any associations between the water quality data and the other developmental data. If there is, then what is the extent (visualisation) and how can we address it (prescriptive).
Let's predict if there are GOING TO BE water quality issues in areas that are not affected right now based on the developmental and water quality data that is available right now. Prevention is better than cure!
It would be great if we could have water quality and industrial/development experts in this analysis, so that they can contribute their valuable inputs!"

Unfortunately, the data had to be anonymized, so you basically can't do a lot of feature engineering. I just applied PCA and kept 0.99 of the linear explanatory power. However, I think it's still really interesting data to just test your general algorithms on imbalanced data. ;)
Inspiration
Since it's heavily imbalanced data, it doesn't make sense to train for accuracy, but rather try to get obtain a good AUC, F1Score, MCC or recall rate, by cross-validating your data. It's interesting to compare different models (logistic regression, decision trees, svms, ...) over these metrics and see the impact that your split in train:test data has on the data.
It might be good strategy to follow these Tactics to combat imbalanced classes."

The overall scope of EMHIRES is to allow users to assess the impact of meteorological and climate variability on the generation of solar power in Europe and not to mime the actual evolution of solar power production in the latest decades. For this reason, the hourly solar power generation time series are released for meteorological conditions of the years 1986-2015 (30 years) without considering any changes in the solar installed capacity. Thus, the installed capacity considered is fixed as the one installed at the end of 2015. For this reason, data from EMHIRES should not be compared with actual power generation data other than referring to the reference year 2015.

This data set deals with the financial distress prediction for a sample of companies.
Content
First column: Company represents sample companies.
Second column: Time shows different time periods that data belongs to. Time series length varies between 1 to 14 for each company.
Third column: The target variable is denoted by ""Financial Distress"" if it is greater than -0.50 the company should be considered as healthy (0). Otherwise, it would be regarded as financially distressed (1).
Fourth column to the last column: The features denoted by x1 to x83, are some financial and non-financial characteristics of the sampled companies. These features belong to the previous time period, which should be used to predict whether the company will be financially distressed or not (classification). Feature x80 is categorical variable.
For example, company 1 is financially distressed at time 4 but company 2 is still healthy at time 14.
This data set is imbalanced (there are 136 financially distressed companies against 286 healthy ones i.e., 136 firm-year observations are financially distressed while 3546 firm-year observations are healthy) and skewed, so f-score should be employed as the performance evaluation criterion.
It should be noted that 30% of this data set should be randomly assigned as hold-out test set so the remaining 70% is used for feature selection and model selection i.e., train set.
Note: 1- This data could be viewed as a classification problem. 2- This data could also be considered as a regression problem and then the result will be converted into a classification. 3- This data could be regarded as a multivariate time series classification.

How centralized is Chicago? In other words, what portion of trips are to or from downtown?
Chicago has an extensive metro system. Are taxis competing with the trains by covering similar routes or supplementing public transit by getting people to and from train stations?

The British National Health Service releases data covering every public sector prescription made in the country. This covers a single year of that data.
Content
Covering all general practices in England, the data includes figures on the number of prescription items that are dispensed each month and information relating to costs.
For each GP practice, the total number of items that were prescribed and then dispensed is shown. The total Net Ingredient Cost and the total Actual Cost of these items is shown.
Chemical level
All prescribed and dispensed medicines (by chemical name), dressings and appliances (at section level) are listed for each GP practice.
Presentation level
All prescribed and dispensed medicines, dressings and appliances are listed at presentation level, for each GP practice. (Presentation level gives the individual drug name, the form, and strength or size accordingly). The total quantity of drugs dispensed (in terms of number of tablets or millilitres, for example) is shown. This data does not list each individual prescription and does not contain any patient identifiable data.
The data have been edited from their original version. During the data preparation process I:
Dropped obsolete and redundant columns.
Normalized the BNF (British National Formulary) codes, BNF names, and practice codes. These steps reduced the total file size by roughly 75%, at the cost of requiring one table join to access some of the data.

Every year since 1947, representatives of UN member states gather at the annual sessions of the United Nations General Assembly. The centrepiece of each session is the General Debate. This is a forum at which leaders and other senior officials deliver statements that present their government‚Äôs perspective on the major issues in world politics. These statements are akin to the annual legislative state-of-the-union addresses in domestic politics. This dataset, the UN General Debate Corpus (UNGDC), includes the corpus of texts of General Debate statements from 1970 (Session 25) to 2016 (Session 71).
Content:
This dataset includes the text of each country‚Äôs statement from the general debate, separated by country, session and year and tagged for each. The text was scanned from PDFs of transcripts of the UN general sessions. As a result, the original scans included page numbers in the text from OCR (Optical character recognition) scans, which have been removed. This dataset only includes English.

This dataset includes over forty years of data from different countries, which allows for the exploration of differences between countries and over time. This allows you to ask both country-specific and longitudinal questions. Some questions that might be interesting:
How has the sentiment of each country‚Äôs general debate changed over time?
What topics have been more or less popular over time and by region?
Can you build a classifier which identifies which country a given text is from?
Are there lexical or syntactic changes over time or differences between region?
How does the latitude of a country affect lexical complexity?"

The data is extracted from geonames, a very exhaustive list of worldwide toponyms. It can be joined with datasets containing geographic fields to facilitate geospatial analysis including mapping.
This datapackage only lists cities above 15,000 inhabitants. Each city is associated with its country and subcountry to reduce the number of ambiguities. Subcountry can be the name of a state (e.g., in United Kingdom or the United States of America) or the major administrative section (e.g., ''region'' in France''). See admin1 field on geonames website for further info about subcountry.
Notice that:
Some cities like Vatican City or Singapore are a whole state so they don't belong to any subcountry. Therefore subcountry is N/A.
There is no guaranty that a city has a unique name in a country and subcountry (At the time of writing, there are about 60 ambiguities). But for each city, the source data primary key geonameid is provided.

You can run the script yourself to update the data and publish them to GitHub/Kaggle: see scripts README

The EMNIST dataset is a set of handwritten character digits derived from the NIST Special Database 19 and converted to a 28x28 pixel image format and dataset structure that directly matches the MNIST dataset. Further information on the dataset contents and conversion process can be found in the paper available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05373v1.
Format
There are six different splits provided in this dataset and each are provided in two formats:
Binary (see emnist_source_files.zip)
CSV (combined labels and images)
Each row is a separate image
785 columns
First column = class_label (see mappings.txt for class label definitions)
Each column after represents one pixel value (784 total for a 28 x 28 image)
ByClass and ByMerge datsets
The full complement of the NIST Special Database 19 is available in the ByClass and ByMerge splits. These two datasets have the same image information but differ in the number of images in each class. Both datasets have an uneven number of images per class and there are more digits than letters. The number of letters roughly equate to the frequency of use in the English language.
train: 697,932
test: 116,323
total: 814,255
classes: ByClass 62 (unbalanced) / ByMerge 47 (unbalanced)
Balanced dataset
The EMNIST Balanced dataset is meant to address the balance issues in the ByClass and ByMerge datasets. It is derived from the ByMerge dataset to reduce mis-classification errors due to capital and lower case letters and also has an equal number of samples per class. This dataset is meant to be the most applicable.
train: 112,800
test: 18,800
total: 131,600

Letters datasets
The EMNIST Letters dataset merges a balanced set of the uppercase and lowercase letters into a single 26-class task.

test: 14,800
total: 103,600
classes: 37 (balanced)
Digits and MNIST datsets
The EMNIST Digits and EMNIST MNIST dataset provide balanced handwritten digit datasets directly compatible with the original MNIST dataset.
train: Digits 240,000 / MNIST 60,000

This is probably the dumbest dataset on Kaggle. The whole point is, however, to provide a common dataset for linear regression. Although such a dataset can easily be generated in Excel with random numbers, results would not be comparable.
Content
The training dataset is a CSV file with 700 data pairs (x,y). The x-values are numbers between 0 and 100. The corresponding y-values have been generated using the Excel function NORMINV(RAND(), x, 3). Consequently, the best estimate for y should be x. The test dataset is a CSV file with 300 data pairs.

The simpler of the two measures, which we denote as L, is the number of different Wikipedia language editions that have an article about a historical character. The more sophisticated measure, which we name the Historical Popularity Index (HPI) corrects L by adding information on the age of the historical character, the concentration of page views among different languages, the coefficient of variation in page views, and the number of page views in languages other than English.

As of January 2012, the OpenFlights Airlines Database contains 5888 airlines. Some of the information is public data and some is contributed by users.
Content
The data is ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) encoded.
Each entry contains the following information: - Airline ID Unique OpenFlights identifier for this airline. - Name Name of the airline. - Alias Alias of the airline. For example, All Nippon Airways is commonly known as ""ANA"". - IATA 2-letter IATA code, if available. - ICAO 3-letter ICAO code, if available. - Callsign Airline callsign. - Country Country or territory where airline is incorporated. - Active ""Y"" if the airline is or has until recently been operational, ""N"" if it is defunct. This field is not reliable: in particular, major airlines that stopped flying long ago, but have not had their IATA code reassigned (eg. Ansett/AN), will incorrectly show as ""Y"".
The special value \N is used for ""NULL"" to indicate that no value is available. This is from a MySQL database where \N is used for NULL.
Notes: Airlines with null codes/callsigns/countries generally represent user-added airlines. Since the data is intended primarily for current flights, defunct IATA codes are generally not included. For example, ""Sabena"" is not listed with a SN IATA code, since ""SN"" is presently used by its successor Brussels Airlines.

This is my grain of sand to help in the Catalonia Independence crisis. The Iberian media has been a key driver to incubate disaffection between Catalonia and Spain. For example, a leading newspaper tweeted boycott and Catalonia 9 times in the last month. In this dataset we analyze:
tweets
topics of tweets and
sentiment differentials in news
Context
The dramatic Catalonia independence crisis offers a unique opportunity to analyze bias in news reporting as opinions on the issue are quite polarized (See #catalanReferendum on twitter). In this dataset, we compare how different newspapers (NYT, Washington-Post, Bloomberg...) have reported one singular specific event in the saga: The reply of the Spanish Government to M.H. Puigdemont speech of October 11th of 2017. For each of the 30 newspapers considered, the most popular news article that reported this news is represented as a row in the dataset. Why this news? The Spanish government, published a pdf called (""requerimiento"") which was faxed to Puigdemont.

I always thought that sentiment analysis was a useless topic, but here there is a chance to use an objective measure to show how polarized reporting has become, (even if sentiment does not account for fakenews, nuances or sarcasm). The linear regressions shows that news written in Spanish language are less positive about the event than the global mean. In other words, sentiment seems strongly biased by language. Bias by location of the newspapers is also analyzed.

This is a data set of mine that I though might be enjoyable to the community. It's concerning Next generation sequencing and Transcriptomics. I used several raw datasets, that are public, but the processing to get to this dataset is extensive. This is my first contribution to kaggle, so be nice, and let me know how I can improve the experience. NGS machines are combined the biggest data producer worldwide. So why not add some (more? ) to kaggle.
A look into Yeast transcriptomics
Background
Yeasts ( in this case saccharomyces cerevisiae) are used in the production of beer, wine, bread and a whole lot of Biotech applications such as creating complex pharmaceuticals. They are living eukaryotic organisms (meaning quite complex). All living organisms store information in their DNA, but action within a cell is carried out by specific Proteins. The path from DNA to Protein (from data to action) is simple. a specific region on the DNA gets transcribed to mRNA, that gets translated to proteins. Common assumption says that the translation step is linear, more mRNA means more protein. Cells actively regulate the amount of protein by the amount of mRNA it creates. The expression of each gene depends on the condition the cell is in (starving, stressed etc..) Modern methods in Biology show us all mRNA that is currently inside a cell. Assuming the linearity of the process, we can get more protein the more specific mRNA is available to a cell. Making mRNA an excellent marker for what is actually happening inside a cell. It is important to consider that mRNA is fragile. It is actively replenished only when it is needed. Both mRNA and proteins are expensive for a cell to produce .
Yeasts are good model organisms for this, since they only have about 6000 genes. They are also single cells which is more homogeneous, and contain few advanced features (splice junctions etc.)
( all of this is heavily simplified, let me know if I should go into more details )
The data
files
The following files are provided SC_expression.csv expression values for each gene over the available conditions **labels_CC.csv ** labels for the individual genes , their status and where known intracellular localization ( see below)
Maybe this would be nice as a little competition, I'll see how this one is going before I'll upload the other label files. Please provide some feedback on the presentation, and whatever else you would want me to share.
background
I used 92 samples from various openly available raw datasets, and ran them through a modern RNAseq pipeline. Spanning a range of different conditions (I hid the raw names). The conditions covered stress conditions, temperature and heavy metals, as well as growth media changes and the deletion of specific genes. Originally I had 150 sets, 92 are of good enough quality. Evaluation was done on gene level. Each gene got it's own row, Samples are columns (some are in replicates over several columns) . Expression levels were normalized with by TPM (transcripts per million), a default normalization procedure. Raw counts would have been integers, normalized they are floats.
Analysis and labels
Genes
The function of individual genes is a matter of dispute. Clearly living cells are complex. The inner machinations of cells are not visible. Gene functionality is commonly inferred indirectly by removing a gene, and test the cells behavior. This is time consuming and not very precise. As you can see in the dataset, there is still much to be done to fully understand even single cell yeasts.
The provided dataset is allows for a different approach to functional classification of genes. The label files contained in the set correspond a gene to a specific label. The classification is based on the official Gene Onthology associations classification. I simplified the nomenclature. Gene functionality is usually given in a hierarchical structure. [inside cell --> cytoplasma --> associated to complex A ... ] I'm only keeping high level associations, and using readable terms instead of GO terms. I'll extend if people are interested.
Labels
CC labels concern Cellular Component.
Where the gene is within a cell. goes into details of found associations. the term 'cellular_component' should be seen as E.g the label 'cellular_component' is synonymous with 'unknown location' . CC is the easiest label to attach to a gene. It is the one that can be studied the easiest. Still there are many genes missing.
MF labels concern Molecular Function. What is the gene doing. [upcoming] BP labels concern Biological Processes. What is the genes involvement. [upcoming]
The core interest here is whether it is possible to improve the genes classification by modeling the data. A common assumption says that genes that are expressed in the same conditions have functional relations. There are a bunch of possible applications out there, many of which are limited by our current state of knowledge on the complex systems we observe, or fail to do so. Bringing biology into the realm of data science is an ongoing effort. Having a better insight into the data might very well help.
Note
The dataset is real, and therefore noisy the labels are incomplete even though I'm using the current state of the art. That is how much is known. Using expression levels for classification was already attempted by softwares like SPELL (Serial Pattern of Expression Levels Locator).
Acknowledgements
I guess I own the dataset. It is a by product of another project of mine. If someone is interested in publishing this, contact me.
Inspiration
Unraveling genetic mechanisms is a complex but rewarding task. Humans and yeast are quite similar in many ways. So apart from the fact that we use it for food and medicine, we might actually use knowledge gained from yeast eventually for studying diseases.

Flaredown is an app that helps patients of chronic autoimmune and invisible illnesses improve their symptoms by avoiding triggers and evaluating their treatments. Each day, patients track their symptom severity, treatments and doses, and any potential environmental triggers (foods, stress, allergens, etc) they encounter.
About the data
Instead of coupling symptoms to a particular illness, Flaredown asks users to create their unique set of conditions, symptoms and treatments (‚Äútrackables‚Äù). They can then ‚Äúcheck-in‚Äù each day and record the severity of symptoms and conditions, the doses of treatments, and ‚Äútag‚Äù the day with any unexpected environmental factors.
User: includes an ID, age, sex, and country.
Condition: an illness or diagnosis, for example Rheumatoid Arthritis, rated on a scale of 0 (not active) to 4 (extremely active).
Symptom: self-explanatory, also rated on a 0‚Äì4 scale.
Treatment: anything a patient uses to improve their symptoms, along with an optional dose, which is a string that describes how much they took during the day. For instance ‚Äú3 x 5mg‚Äù.
Tag: a string representing an environmental factor that does not occur every day, for example ‚Äúate dairy‚Äù or ‚Äúrainy day‚Äù.
Food: food items were seeded from the publicly-available USDA food database. Users have also added many food items manually.
Weather: weather is pulled automatically for the user's postal code from the Dark Sky API. Weather parameters include a description, precipitation intensity, humidity, pressure, and min/max temperatures for the day.
If users do not see a symptom, treatment, tag, or food in our database (for instance ‚ÄúAbdominal Pain‚Äù as a symptom) they may add it by simply naming it. This means that the data requires some cleaning, but it is patient-centered and indicates their primary concerns.
Suggested Questions
Does X treatment affect Y symptom positively/negatively/not at all? What are the most strongly-correlated symptoms and treatments?
Are there subsets within our current diagnoses that could more accurately represent symptoms and predict effective treatments?
Can we reliably predict what triggers a flare for a given user or all users with a certain condition?
Could we recommend treatments more effectively based on similarity of users, rather than specific symptoms and conditions? (Netflix recommendations for treatments)
Can we quantify a patient‚Äôs level of disease activity based on their symptoms? How different is it from our existing measures?
Can we predict which symptom should be treated to have the greatest effect on a given illness?
How accurately can we guess a condition based on a user‚Äôs symptoms?
Can we detect new interactions between treatments?

This dataset includes a log of all physical item checkouts from Seattle Public Library. The dataset begins with checkouts occurring in April 2005, and is regularly updated. Renewals are not included.
Content
The dataset contains several types of files:
Checkout records hold the raw data. I've dropped several columns from these files in order to shrink the total dataset size down from a couple of dozen gigabytes; they can be rebuilt by merging with the library collection inventory.
The data dictionary allows you to decode the 'ItemType' column from the checkout records.
The library collection inventory is a dataset in its own right and stores important metadata about each title, such as the author and subjects.
Inspiration
Can you predict which books will be checked out in the coming month? SPL posts fresh data every month, so you can check your forecast by downloading the new data from them.
With a bit of imagination, this can be a great dataset for logistics modeling. Make some assumptions about each location's storage capacity and where a book was checked out from and you've got a warehouse resource allocation problem.

The data was scraped from several websites in Czech Republic and Germany over a period of more than a year. Originally I wanted to build a model for estimating whether a car is a good buy or a bad buy based on the posting. But I was unable to create a model I could be satisfied with and now have no use for this data. I'm a great believer in open data, so here goes.
Content
The scrapers were tuned slowly over the course of the year and some of the sources were completely unstructured, so as a result the data is dirty, there are missing values and some values are very obviously wrong (e.g. phone numbers scraped as mileage etc.)
There are roughly 3,5 Million rows and the following columns:
maker - normalized all lowercase
model - normalized all lowercase
mileage - in KM
manufacture_year
engine_displacement - in ccm
engine_power - in kW
body_type - almost never present, but I scraped only personal cars, no motorcycles or utility vehicles
color_slug - also almost never present
stk_year - year of the last emission control
transmission - automatic or manual
door_count
seat_count
fuel_type - gasoline, diesel, cng, lpg, electric
date_created - when the ad was scraped
date_last_seen - when the ad was last seen. Our policy was to remove all ads older than 60 days
price_eur - list price converted to EUR

Starting something in FinTech is the most difficult thing. You have no open data. These days I'm trying to do some algo-trading. Maybe not in true sense, because it's not high frequency scalping. But anyway that's that.
What?
The data gives almost-Realtime data for half of the Nifty 50 stocks for last week of May and first 2 Weeks of July.
Now here is the obvious question. The dataset does not have timestamp. That's because it is collected via Web-Socket streaming as it happens. Sometimes once in a couple of seconds, sometimes 10-15 times in the same span. So there is no point to timestamp IMHO. Anyway it'll be client-side timestamp, so not a true timestamp.

Content
This data set consists of three types of entities: (a) the specification of an auto in terms of various characteristics, (b) its assigned insurance risk rating, (c) its normalized losses in use as compared to other cars. The second rating corresponds to the degree to which the auto is more risky than its price indicates. Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its price. Then, if it is more risky (or less), this symbol is adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale. Actuarians call this process ""symboling"". A value of +3 indicates that the auto is risky, -3 that it is probably pretty safe.
The third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured vehicle year. This value is normalized for all autos within a particular size classification (two-door small, station wagons, sports/speciality, etc...), and represents the average loss per car per year.
Note: Several of the attributes in the database could be used as a ""class"" attribute.

This News Dataset is a persistent historical archive of noteable events in the Indian subcontinent from start-2001 to end-2017, recorded in real time by the journalists of India.
Times Group as a news agency, reaches out a very wide audience across Asia and drawfs every other agency in the quantity of English Articles published per day. Due to the heavy daily volume (avg. 650 articles) over multiple years, this data offers a deep insight into Indian society, its priorities, events, issues and talking points and how they have unfolded over time.
It is possible to chop this dataset into a smaller piece for a more focused analysis, based on one or more facets.

The headlines are extracted from several GB of raw HTML files using Jsoup, Java and Bash. The entire process takes 3.5 minutes.
This logic also : chooses the best worded headline for each article (longest one is usually picked) ; clusters about 17k categories to 200 large groups ; removes records where the date is ambiguous (9k cases) ; finally cleans the selected headline via a string 'domestication' function (which I use for any wild text from the internet).
The final categories are as per the latest sitemap. Around 1.5k rare categories remain and these records (~20k) can be filtered out easily during analysis. The category is unknown for ~200k records.

Our ultimate goal is for BankSim to be usable to model relevant scenarios that combine normal payments and injected known fraud signatures. The data sets generated by BankSim contain no personal information or disclosure of legal and private customer transactions. Therefore, it can be shared by academia, and others, to develop and reason about fraud detection methods. Synthetic data has the added benefit of being easier to acquire, faster and at less cost, for experimentation even for those that have access to their own data. We argue that BankSim generates data that usefully approximates the relevant aspects of the real data.
Content
We ran BankSim for 180 steps (approx. six months), several times and calibrated the parameters in order to obtain a distribution that get close enough to be reliable for testing. We collected several log files and selected the most accurate. We injected thieves that aim to steal an average of three cards per step and perform about two fraudulent transactions per day. We produced 594643 records in total. Where 587443 are normal payments and 7200 fraudulent transactions. Since this is a randomised simulation the values are of course not identical to original data.

The script used to acquire all of the following data can be found in this GitHub repository. This repository also contains the modeling codes and will be updated continually, so welcome starring or watching!
Stock market data can be interesting to analyze and as a further incentive, strong predictive models can have large financial payoff. The amount of financial data on the web is seemingly endless. A large and well structured dataset on a wide array of companies can be hard to come by. Here provided a dataset with historical stock prices (last 12 years) for 29 of 30 DJIA companies (excluding 'V' because it does not have the whole 12 years data).

In the future if you wish for a more up to date dataset, this can be used to acquire new versions of the .csv files.
Content
The data is presented in a couple of formats to suit different individual's needs or computational limitations. I have included files containing 13 years of stock data (in the all_stocks_2006-01-01_to_2018-01-01.csv and corresponding folder) and a smaller version of the dataset (all_stocks_2017-01-01_to_2018-01-01.csv) with only the past year's stock data for those wishing to use something more manageable in size.
The folder individual_stocks_2006-01-01_to_2018-01-01 contains files of data for individual stocks, labelled by their stock ticker name. The all_stocks_2006-01-01_to_2018-01-01.csv and all_stocks_2017-01-01_to_2018-01-01.csv contain this same data, presented in merged .csv files. Depending on the intended use (graphing, modelling etc.) the user may prefer one of these given formats.
All the files have the following columns: Date - in format: yy-mm-dd
Open - price of the stock at market open (this is NYSE data so all in USD)
High - Highest price reached in the day
Low Close - Lowest price reached in the day
Volume - Number of shares traded
Name - the stock's ticker name
Inspiration
This dataset lends itself to a some very interesting visualizations. One can look at simple things like how prices change over time, graph an compare multiple stocks at once, or generate and graph new metrics from the data provided. From these data informative stock stats such as volatility and moving averages can be easily calculated. The million dollar question is: can you develop a model that can beat the market and allow you to make statistically informed trades!

HappyDB is a corpus of more than 100,000 happy moments crowd-sourced via Amazon‚Äôs Mechanical Turk.
Each worker is given the following task: What made you happy today? Reflect on the past 24 hours, and recall three actual events that happened to you that made you happy. Write down your happy moment in a complete sentence. (Write three such moments.)
The goal of the corpus is to advance the understanding of the causes of happiness through text-based reflection.
More information is available on the HappyDB website (https://rit-public.github.io/HappyDB/).
Content:
cleaned_hm.csv: the cleaned-up corpus of 100,000 crowd-sourced happy moments. For cleaning up, we have done spell checking over the whole corpus, and remove empty or one-word statements. The raw happy moments are retained for reference, and the author of each happy moment is represented by the his/her worker ID.
demographic.csv: the demographic information of the worker who provided the moment. The information includes worker id, age, country, gender, marital status, and status of parenthood.
Have fun with the data! Feel free to contact us with any questions.
Sample questions:
To provide some inspiration, here are a few sample interesting exploration questions.
What are the popular sports/movies/books/purchased products/tourist destinations/... that make people happy?
Can we predict gender/marriage status/parenthood/age groups based on happy moment texts?
How many indoor and outdoor activities are in the corpus respectively?
Can we find interesting ways of clustering happy moments?

We thank CI&T for the support and permission to share a sample of real usage data from its internal communication platform: Deskdrop.
Inspiration
The two main approaches for Recommender Systems are Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering.
In the RecSys community, there are some popular datasets available with users ratings on items (explicit feedback), like MovieLens and Netflix Prize, which are useful for Collaborative Filtering techniques.
Therefore, it is very difficult to find open datasets with additional item attributes, which would allow the application of Content-Based filtering techniques or Hybrid approaches, specially in the domain of ephemeral textual items (eg. articles and news).
News datasets are also reported in academic literature as very sparse, in the sense that, as users are usually not required to log in in news portals, IDs are based on device cookies, making it hard to track the users page visits in different portals, browsing sessions and devices.
This difficult scenario for research and experiments on Content Recommender Systems was the main motivation for the sharing of this dataset."

Context
Last year, while I was attending a data science course in Germany, my country was impeaching its president. My colleagues asked me to explain what was happening in Brazil and the possible political outcomes in South America. Although I was able to give a general context and tell multiple arguments in favor and against the impeachment, deep inside, my answer was ""I really don't know"".
Understanding what happens in Politics is something that takes a lot of effort and research. When I decided I had to use my tech skills to make myself a better citizen, I dived into government data and started Operation Serenata de Amor.
After reporting hundreds of politicians for small acts of corruption and learning how to encourage the population to engage in the democratic processes, my studies drove me to understand the legislative activity.
Brazilians elect 594 citizens to be their representatives in the National Congress. How can we be sure that they are not defending their own interests or those who paid for their campaigns? My way, as a data scientist, is to ask the data.
Content
The National Congress of Brazil is composed of a Lower (Chamber of Deputies) and an Upper House (Federal Senate). In the first version of this dataset, you are going to find data only from the Chamber of Deputies. With 513 representatives, 86% of the congresspeople, I hope you have enough data to explore for some time.
Would be impossible for me, a citizen without government ties, to collect this data without the help of public servants. I processed 9,717 fixed-width files and 73 XML's made officially available by the Chamber of Deputies and created 5 CSV's containing the same information. Multiple fields of the same file telling the same thing (e.g. body_id, body_name and body_abbreviation) were removed.
Data on session attendance, votes, and propositions since past century were collected and scripted in a reproducible manner. The data collection and pre-processing scripts are available in a GitHub repository, under an open source license.
Everything was collected from the Chamber of Deputies website at December 27, 2017, containing the whole legislative activity of the year. Presence and votes date from 1999, propositions go as far as 1946.
When in question about the legislative process and how the sessions work in real world, the Internal Regulation of the Chamber of Deputies is the best Portuguese documentation for research. It's free!
Acknowledgements
Since the data was collected from a government website and the Brazilian law states that access to this information is free to any citizen, I am placing my own work published here in Public Domain.
I'd like to thank the hundreds of people financially supporting the work of Operation Serenata de Amor and those responsible for passing the Information Access bill in 2011.
Inspiration
The legislative activity should tell the history while it's happening. How much has the Congress changed over the past decades? Do the congresspeople maintain the same political views or they vary on a weekly basis? Do people vote together with their state or party peers? How often? Can you model an algorithm to tell us the real parties inside Brazilian Congress?"

Here you find a very simple, beginner-friendly data set. No sparse matrices, no fancy tools needed to understand what's going on. Just a couple of rows and columns. Super simple stuff. As explained below, this data set is used for a competition. As it turns out, this competition tends to reveal a common truth in data science: KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid
What is so special about this data set is, given it's simplicity, it pays off to use ""simple"" classifiers as well. This year's competition was won by a C5.0 . Can you do better?
Description
We are looking at cold call results. Turns out, same salespeople called existing insurance customers up and tried to sell car insurance. What you have are details about the called customers. Their age, job, marital status, whether the have home insurance, a car loan, etc. As I said, super simple.
What I would love to see is some of you applying some crazy XGBoost classifiers, which we can square off against some logistic regressions. It would be curious to see what comes out on top. Thank you for your time, I hope you enjoy using the data set.

Since SNL is such a long running TV show I thought it would be interesting to see how it developed over time. There are also some prejudices around, like ""there was a big slump from season X to Y"". Do the user ratings reflect that? I provided an example analysis, so that everyone can get started easily with the data.

pollution",CSV,2 GB,CC0,"3,557 views",411 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/epa/hazardous-air-pollutants,"Context:
Hazardous air pollutants, also known as toxic air pollutants or air toxics, are those pollutants that are known or suspected to cause cancer or other serious health effects, such as reproductive effects or birth defects, or adverse environmental effects. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) tracks 187 air pollutants. See https://www.epa.gov/haps/ for more information.
Content:
The daily summary file contains data for every monitor (sampled parameter) in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) database for each day. This file will contain a daily summary record that is: 1. The aggregate of all sub-daily measurements taken at the monitor. 2. The single sample value if the monitor takes a single, daily sample (e.g., there is only one sample with a 24-hour duration). In this case, the mean and max daily sample will have the same value.
Fields Descriptions: 1. State Code: The Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code of the state in which the monitor resides.
County Code: The FIPS code of the county in which the monitor resides.
Site Num: A unique number within the county identifying the site.
Parameter Code: The AQS code corresponding to the parameter measured by the monitor.
POC: This is the ‚ÄúParameter Occurrence Code‚Äù used to distinguish different instruments that measure the same parameter at the same site.
Latitude: The monitoring site‚Äôs angular distance north of the equator measured in decimal degrees.
Longitude: The monitoring site‚Äôs angular distance east of the prime meridian measured in decimal degrees.
Datum: The Datum associated with the Latitude and Longitude measures.
Parameter Name: The name or description assigned in AQS to the parameter measured by the monitor. Parameters may be pollutants or non-pollutants.
Sample Duration: The length of time that air passes through the monitoring device before it is analyzed (measured). So, it represents an averaging period in the atmosphere (for example, a 24-hour sample duration draws ambient air over a collection filter for 24 straight hours). For continuous monitors, it can represent an averaging time of many samples (for example, a 1-hour value may be the average of four one-minute samples collected during each quarter of the hour).
Pollutant Standard: A description of the ambient air quality standard rules used to aggregate statistics. (See description at beginning of document.)
Date Local: The calendar date for the summary. All daily summaries are for the local standard day (midnight to midnight) at the monitor.
Units of Measure: The unit of measure for the parameter. QAD always returns data in the standard units for the parameter. Submitters are allowed to report data in any unit and EPA converts to a standard unit so that we may use the data in calculations.
Event Type: Indicates whether data measured during exceptional events are included in the summary. A wildfire is an example of an exceptional event; it is something that affects air quality, but the local agency has no control over. No Events means no events occurred. Events Included means events occurred and the data from them is included in the summary. Events Excluded means that events occurred but data form them is excluded from the summary. Concurred Events Excluded means that events occurred but only EPA concurred exclusions are removed from the summary. If an event occurred for the parameter in question, the data will have multiple records for each monitor.
Observation Count: The number of observations (samples) taken during the day.
Observation Percent: The percent representing the number of observations taken with respect to the number scheduled to be taken during the day. This is only calculated for monitors where measurements are required (e.g., only certain parameters).
Arithmetic Mean: The average (arithmetic mean) value for the day.
1st Max Value: The highest value for the day.
1st Max Hour: The hour (on a 24-hour clock) when the highest value for the day (the previous field) was taken.
AQI: The Air Quality Index for the day for the pollutant, if applicable.
Method Code: An internal system code indicating the method (processes, equipment, and protocols) used in gathering and measuring the sample. The method name is in the next column.
Method Name: A short description of the processes, equipment, and protocols used in gathering and measuring the sample.
Local Site Name: The name of the site (if any) given by the State, local, or tribal air pollution control agency that operates it.
Address: The approximate street address of the monitoring site.
State Name: The name of the state where the monitoring site is located.
County Name: The name of the county where the monitoring site is located.
City Name: The name of the city where the monitoring site is located. This represents the legal incorporated boundaries of cities and not urban areas.
CBSA Name: The name of the core bases statistical area (metropolitan area) where the monitoring site is located.
Date of Last Change: The date the last time any numeric values in this record were updated in the AQS data system.

People exposed to toxic air pollutants at sufficient concentrations and durations may have an increased chance of getting cancer or experiencing other serious health effects. These health effects can include damage to the immune system, as well as neurological, reproductive (e.g., reduced fertility), developmental, respiratory and other health problems. In addition to exposure from breathing air toxics, some toxic air pollutants such as mercury can deposit onto soils or surface waters, where they are taken up by plants and ingested by animals and are eventually magnified up through the food chain. Like humans, animals may experience health problems if exposed to sufficient quantities of air toxics over time. Use this dataset to find out where the highest concentrations of hazardous air pollutants are for each state. You could also use the GPS locations to find out where the EPA has the most monitoring stations and identify places that could use more."

Next time you take a bite, consider this: roughly one in six (or 48 million) people in the United States get sick from eating contaminated food per year. More than 250 pathogens and toxins have been known to cause foodborne illness and almost all of them can cause an outbreak.
A foodborne disease outbreak occurs when two or more people get the same illness from the same contaminated food or drink. While most foodborne illnesses are not part of a recognized outbreak, outbreaks provide important information on how germs spread, which foods cause illness, and how to prevent infection.
Public health agencies in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories, and Freely Associated States have primary responsibility for identifying and investigating outbreaks and use a standard form to report outbreaks voluntarily to CDC. During 1998‚Äì2008, reporting was made through the electronic Foodborne Outbreak Reporting System (eFORS).
Content
This dataset provides data on foodborne disease outbreaks reported to CDC from 1998 through 2015. Data fields include year, state (outbreaks occurring in more than one state are listed as ""multistate""), location where the food was prepared, reported food vehicle and contaminated ingredient, etiology (the pathogen, toxin, or chemical that caused the illnesses), status (whether the etiology was confirmed or suspected), total illnesses, hospitalizations, and fatalities. In many outbreak investigations, a specific food vehicle is not identified; for these outbreaks, the food vehicle variable is blank.

FARS contains data on a census of fatal traffic crashes within the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. To be included in FARS, a crash must involve a motor vehicle traveling on a trafficway customarily open to the public and result in the death of a person (occupant of a vehicle or a non-occupant) within 30 days of the crash. FARS has been operational since 1975 and has collected information on over 989,451 motor vehicle fatalities and collects information on over 100 different coded data elements that characterizes the crash, the vehicle, and the people involved.
FARS is vital to the mission of NHTSA to reduce the number of motor vehicle crashes and deaths on our nation's highways, and subsequently, reduce the associated economic loss to society resulting from those motor vehicle crashes and fatalities. FARS data is critical to understanding the characteristics of the environment, trafficway, vehicles, and persons involved in the crash.
NHTSA has a cooperative agreement with an agency in each state government to provide information in a standard format on fatal crashes in the state. Data is collected, coded and submitted into a micro-computer data system and transmitted to Washington, D.C. Quarterly files are produced for analytical purposes to study trends and evaluate the effectiveness highway safety programs.

It is comprised of over 50 labeled real-world and artificial timeseries data files plus a novel scoring mechanism designed for real-time applications. All of the data and code is fully open-source, with extensive documentation, and a scoreboard of anomaly detection algorithms: github.com/numenta/NAB. The full dataset is included here, but please go to the repo for details on how to evaluate anomaly detection algorithms on NAB.
NAB Data Corpus
The NAB corpus of 58 timeseries data files is designed to provide data for research in streaming anomaly detection. It is comprised of both real-world and artifical timeseries data containing labeled anomalous periods of behavior. Data are ordered, timestamped, single-valued metrics. All data files contain anomalies, unless otherwise noted.
The majority of the data is real-world from a variety of sources such as AWS server metrics, Twitter volume, advertisement clicking metrics, traffic data, and more. All data is included in the repository, with more details in the data readme. We are in the process of adding more data, and actively searching for more data. Please contact us at nab@numenta.org if you have similar data (ideally with known anomalies) that you would like to see incorporated into NAB.
The NAB version will be updated whenever new data (and corresponding labels) is added to the corpus; NAB is currently in v1.0.

This dataset contains ground state energies of 16,242 molecules calculated by quantum mechanical simulations.
Content
The data contains 1277 columns. The first 1275 columns are entries in the Coulomb matrix that act as molecular features. The 1276th column is the Pubchem Id where the molecular structures are obtained. The 1277th column is the atomization energy calculated by simulations using the Quantum Espresso package.
In the csv file, the first column (X1) is the data index and unused.
Past Research
The data is used for a publication in Journal of Chemical Physics. A blog post was also published explaining the data and the research behind it in less technical terms.
A Github repository is available that contains the source code used for generating the data, as well as some of the R scripts used for analysis.
Inspiration
Simulations of molecular properties are computationally expensive. The purpose of this project is to use machine learning methods to come up with a model that can predict molecular properties from a database of simulations. If this can be done with high accuracy, properties of new molecules can be calculated using the trained model. This could open up many possibilities in computational design and discovery of molecules, compounds and new drugs.
The purpose is to use the 1275 molecular features to predict the atomization energy. This is a regression problem so mean squared error is minimized during training.
I am looking for Kagglers to find the best model and reduce mean squared error as much as possible!"

Diego Costa scores a goal every 15 minutes of the match he plays.
Harry Kane is the youngest player to have scored 100 Premier League goals.
Such statistics (if true) are a compelling read.
But, to know -
Nathaniel Chalobah has 70% probability of scoring against Stoke City this weekend.
Alexis Sanchez will score around 2 goals this month.
Cesc Fabregas is going to assist this weekend.
There's 70% David De Gea is going to have a clean-sheet.
Such statistics and much more lend so much credibility to decision making. It would enable Fantasy Premier League team owners to decide :-
a. When to choose which player?
b. When is the right time to use the WildCard?
c. If it is time to be patient with a signing?
d. Who to watch out for?
In order to do this, one needs data to back your predictions. Hence, I was keen on retrieving all this data.
Future Scope -
Predict the best team for the upcoming week.
Predict the best player (Highest value for money) (Goalkeeper, Defender, MId-fielder, Attacker)
Suggest possible changes in formation if need be."
ADS-16 Computational Advertising Dataset,A collection of 300 real ads voted by 120 unacquainted individuals,GiorgioRoffo,20,"Version 1,2017-01-15",marketing,Other,754 MB,Other,"7,276 views",846 downloads,8 kernels,,https://www.kaggle.com/groffo/ads16-dataset,"Context
In the last decade, new ways of shopping online have increased the possibility of buying products and services more easily and faster than ever. In this new context, personality is a key determinant in the decision making of the consumer when shopping. A person's buying choices are influenced by psychological factors like impulsiveness; indeed some consumers may be more susceptible to making impulse purchases than others. Since affective metadata are more closely related to the user's experience than generic parameters, accurate predictions reveal important aspects of user's attitudes, social life, including attitude of others and social identity. This work proposes a highly innovative research that uses a personality perspective to determine the unique associations among the consumer's buying tendency and advert recommendations. In fact, the lack of a publicly available benchmark for computational advertising do not allow both the exploration of this intriguing research direction and the evaluation of recent algorithms. We present the ADS Dataset, a publicly available benchmark consisting of 300 real advertisements (i.e., Rich Media Ads, Image Ads, Text Ads) rated by 120 unacquainted individuals, enriched with Big-Five users' personality factors and 1,200 personal users' pictures.

Inspiration
We collected and introduced a representative benchmark for computational advertising enriched with affective-like metadata such as personality factors. The benchmark allows to (i) explore the relationship between consumer characteristics, attitude toward online shopping and advert recommendation, (ii) identify the underlying dimensions of consumer shopping motivations and attitudes toward online in-store conversions, and (iii) have a reference benchmark for comparison of state-of-the-art advertisement recommender systems (ARSs). To the best of our knowledge, the ADS dataset is the first attempt at providing a set of advertisements scored by the users according to their interest into the content. We hope that this work motivates researchers to take into account the use of personality factors as an integral part of their future work, since there is a high potential that incorporating these kind of users' characteristics into ARS could enhance recommendation quality and user experience."

Everyone who speaks a language, speaks it with an accent. A particular accent essentially reflects a person's linguistic background. When people listen to someone speak with a different accent from their own, they notice the difference, and they may even make certain biased social judgments about the speaker.
The speech accent archive is established to uniformly exhibit a large set of speech accents from a variety of language backgrounds. Native and non-native speakers of English all read the same English paragraph and are carefully recorded. The archive is constructed as a teaching tool and as a research tool. It is meant to be used by linguists as well as other people who simply wish to listen to and compare the accents of different English speakers.
This dataset allows you to compare the demographic and linguistic backgrounds of the speakers in order to determine which variables are key predictors of each accent. The speech accent archive demonstrates that accents are systematic rather than merely mistaken speech.
All of the linguistic analyses of the accents are available for public scrutiny. We welcome comments on the accuracy of our transcriptions and analyses.
Content:
This dataset contains 2140 speech samples, each from a different talker reading the same reading passage. Talkers come from 177 countries and have 214 different native languages. Each talker is speaking in English.

The Kepler Space Observatory is a NASA-build satellite that was launched in 2009. The telescope is dedicated to searching for exoplanets in star systems besides our own, with the ultimate goal of possibly finding other habitable planets besides our own. The original mission ended in 2013 due to mechanical failures, but the telescope has nevertheless been functional since 2014 on a ""K2"" extended mission.
Kepler had verified 1284 new exoplanets as of May 2016. As of October 2017 there are over 3000 confirmed exoplanets total (using all detection methods, including ground-based ones). The telescope is still active and continues to collect new data on its extended mission.
Content
This dataset is a cumulative record of all observed Kepler ""objects of interest"" ‚Äî basically, all of the approximately 10,000 exoplanet candidates Kepler has taken observations on.
This dataset has an extensive data dictionary, which can be accessed here. Highlightable columns of note are:
kepoi_name: A KOI is a target identified by the Kepler Project that displays at least one transit-like sequence within Kepler time-series photometry that appears to be of astrophysical origin and initially consistent with a planetary transit hypothesis
kepler_name: [These names] are intended to clearly indicate a class of objects that have been confirmed or validated as planets‚Äîa step up from the planet candidate designation.
koi_disposition: The disposition in the literature towards this exoplanet candidate. One of CANDIDATE, FALSE POSITIVE, NOT DISPOSITIONED or CONFIRMED.
koi_pdisposition: The disposition Kepler data analysis has towards this exoplanet candidate. One of FALSE POSITIVE, NOT DISPOSITIONED, and CANDIDATE.
koi_score: A value between 0 and 1 that indicates the confidence in the KOI disposition. For CANDIDATEs, a higher value indicates more confidence in its disposition, while for FALSE POSITIVEs, a higher value indicates less confidence in that disposition.

The Counted is the most thorough public accounting for deadly use of force in the US, but it will operate as an imperfect work in progress ‚Äì and will be updated by Guardian reporters and interactive journalists frequently.
Any deaths arising directly from encounters with law enforcement will be included in the database. This will inevitably include, but will likely not be limited to, people who were shot, tasered and struck by police vehicles as well those who died in police custody. Self-inflicted deaths during encounters with law enforcement or in police custody or detention facilities will not be included.
The US government has no comprehensive record of the number of people killed by law enforcement. This lack of basic data has been glaring amid the protests, riots and worldwide debate set in motion by the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in August 2014. The Guardian agrees with those analysts, campaign groups, activists and authorities who argue that such accounting is a prerequisite for an informed public discussion about the use of force by police.

Horse racing is one of the sport which involved many gambling activities. Million of people in the world tried to find their 'winning formula' in order to gain profit from betting. Since there are many factors which could affect the race result, data analysis on horse racing became much interesting.
Hong Kong horse racing is especially interesting due to the follow reasons:
- The handicap system made the race more competitive
- Horse pool is small compared to other countries so that horses will meet their rivalries very often in the races
- Limited number of jockey/trainer
- Data are well managed by the official :)
The Dataset
The dataset contains the race result of 1561 local races throughout Hong Kong racing seasons 2014-16 and more information will be added into the dataset. The dataset is divided into two tables (which can be joined by race_id). Most of the column description can be found below with one extra piece of information:
finishing_position - For special incident, please refer to here
So, can you find any pattern for the winner under some condition? Did you spot out a winning strategy? (FYI, betting on all horse equally will bring a loss of ~17.5% on average) Which jockey/trainer is worth to follow?
Don't wait and start the data analysis! You may find some of the kernels I created useful. Enjoy! And please remember to share your finding with the community!

multiclass classification",Other,126 MB,CC0,"3,119 views",204 downloads,8 kernels,2 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/nicw102168/snake-eyes,"Context
Invariance to translation and rotation is an important attribute we would like image classifiers to have in many applications. For many problems, even if there doesn't seem to be a lot of translation in the data, augmenting it with these transformations is often beneficial. There are not many datasets where these transformations are clearly relevant, though. The ""Snake Eyes"" dataset seeks to provide a problem where rotation and translation are clearly a fundamental aspect of the problem, and not just something intuitively believed to be involved.
Image classifiers are frequently utilized in a pipeline where a bounding box is first extracted from the complete image, and this process might provide centered data to the classifier. Some translation might still be present in the data the classifier sees, though, making the phenomenon relevant to classification nevertheless. A Snake Eyes classifier can clearly benefit from such a pre-processing. But the point here is trying to learn how much a classifier can learn to do by itself. In special we would like to demonstrate the ""built-in"" invariance to translations from CNNs.
Content
Snake Eyes contains artificial images simulating the a roll of one or two dice. The face patterns were modified to contain at most 3 black spots, making it impossible to solve the problem by merely counting them. The data was synthesized using a Python program, each image produced from a set of floating-point parameters modeling the position and angle of each dice.
The data format is binary, with records of 401 bytes. The first byte contains the class (1 to 12, notice it does not start at 0), and the other 400 bytes are the image rows. We offer 1 million images, split in 10 files with 100k records each, and an extra test set with 10,000 images.
Inspiration
We were inspired by the popular ""tiny image"" datasets often studied in ML research: MNIST, CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST. Our dataset has smaller images, though, only 20x20, and 12 classes. The reduced proportions should help approximate the actual 3D and 6D manifolds of each class with the available number of data points (1 million images).
The data is artificial, with limited and very well-defined patterns, noise-free and properly anti-aliased. This is not about improving from 95% to 97% accuracy and wondering if 99% is possible with a deeper network. We don't expect less than 100% precision to be achieved with any method eventually. What we are interested to see is how do different methods compare in efficiency, how hard is it to train different models, and how the translation and rotation invariance is enforced or achieved.
We are also interested in studying the concept of manifold learning. The data has some intra-class variability due to different possible face combinations with two dice. But most of the variation comes from translation and rotation. We hope to have sampled enough data to really allow for the extraction of these manifolds in 400 dimensions, and to investigate topics such as the role of pre-training, and the relation between modeling the manifold of the whole data and of the separate classes.
Translations alone already create quite non-convex manifolds, but our classes also have the property that some linear combinations are actually a different class (e.g. two images from the ""2"" face make an image from the ""4"" class). We are curious to see how this property can make the problem more challenging to different techniques.
We are also secretly hoping to have created the image-detection version of the infamous ""spiral"" problem for neural networks. We are offering the prize of one ham sandwich, collected at my local caf√©, to the first person who manages to train a neural network to solve this problem, convolutional or not, and using just traditional techniques such as logistic or ReLU activation functions and SGD training. 99% accuracy is enough. The resulting network may be susceptible to adversarial instances, this is fine, but we'll be constantly complaining about it in your ear while you eat the sandwich."

The data csv is arranged in a long format, with the time_series_code column tying it back to the metadata csv. If you're trying to figure out what data is available, you'll want to start with the metadata.
Just over a third of the time series store error codes, usually confidence intervals, rather than actual values. The metadata for these time series will have values in the columns et_code, et_desc, and et_unit.
All of the dates are stored as complete beginning of the period dates, but all of the time series are at either monthly, quarterly, or annual resolution. Exact days and months are provided for convenience when aligning time series and so that you don't have to unpack period codes like 'Q22009'.
There may be many time series bundled under a given data category or description. For example, the largest category (taxes) contains dozens of types of tax categories, and each of those contains a separate time series for each state in the country.
Two of the error code time series have non-numeric values. To convert the values column into reasonable units you'll need to drop all entries equal to the string Less than .05 percent.
The data have been substantially reformatted from how they are provided by the Census Bureau. You can find the script I used to prepare the data here.

With multispectral images, we can capture more data per pixel, and understand objects based on their chemical composition or the variation of composition that encompasses an object. Examples of this might be, is the image you see an apple or an orange? Further, is the apple or the orange real? If it is plastic, was it made in Mexico or India? Real life impacts of using spectral data as part of object detection in images could one day save a life, if a self driving car could not only detect faces, but also the difference between skin and plastic, a lone pedestrian could avoid being if it was a choice between them or a group of three manikins.
This sample data contains a series of multispectral images of handwritten numbers between 0 and 9, from six different peoples, using two different pens. And here I am asking the great kagglers to explore and build models to tell each of the numbers from one another and with what ink each was written in.
Data
Each csv file contains pixels for 10 grayscale images (350 * 350) that represent 10 channels for the multispectral image, where X, Y represent the location of the pixel, and channel0 - channel9 represent channels.
And we also have a labels csv that contains labels for each pixel csv file.

MNIST as .jpg,Kaggle Digit Recognizer Competition Dataset as .jpg Image Files,Stuart Colianni,19,"Version 1,2017-05-15",,Other,18 MB,CC0,"7,464 views","1,770 downloads",4 kernels,,https://www.kaggle.com/scolianni/mnistasjpg,"Context
The Digit Recognizer competition uses the popular MNIST dataset to challenge Kagglers to classify digits correctly. In this dataset, the images are represented as strings of pixel values in train.csv and test.csv. Often, it is beneficial for image data to be in an image format rather than a string format. Therefore, I have converted the aforementioned datasets from text in .csv files to organized .jpg files.
Content
This dataset is composed of four files:
trainingSet.tar.gz (10.2 MB) - This file contains ten sub folders labeled 0 to 9. Each of the sub folders contains .jpg images from the Digit Recognizer competition's train.csv dataset, corresponding to the folder name (ie. folder 2 contains images of 2's, etc.). In total, there are 42,000 images in the training set.
testSet.tar.gz (6.8 MB) - This file contains the .jpg images from the Digit Recognizer competition's test.csv dataset. In total, there are 28,000 images in the test set.
trainingSample.zip (407 KB) - This file contains ten sub folders labeled 0 to 9. Each sub folder contains 60 .jpg images from the training set, for a total of 600 images.
testSample.zip (233 KB) - This file contains a 350 image sample from the test set.
Acknowledgements
As previously mentioned, all data presented here is simply a cleaned version of the data presented in Kaggle's Digit Recognizer competition. The division of the MNIST dataset into training and test sets exactly mirrors that presented in the competition.
Inspiration
I created this dataset when exploring TensorFlow's Inception model. Inception is a massive CNN built by Google to compete in the ImageNet competition. By way of Transfer Learning, the final layer of Inception can be retrained, rendering the model useful for general classification tasks. In retraining the model, .jpg images must be used, thereby necessitating to the creation of this dataset.
My hope in experimenting with Inception was to achieve an accuracy of around 98.5% or higher on the MNIST dataset. Unfortunately, the maximum accuracy I reached with Inception was only 95.314%. If you are interested in my code for said attempt, it is available on my GitHub repository Kaggle MNIST Inception CNN.

Specific Language Impairment is a condition that effects roughly 7% of 5-year old children. It is characterised by a lack of language ability in comparison to your peers but with no obvious mental or physical disability. Diagnosis can tend to be laborious, thus automating this process using NLP and ML techniques might be of interest to paediatricians and speech pathologists.
Content
This study evaluated three datasets obtained via the CHILDES project. All the datasets consist of narratives from a child attempting to complete a wordless picture task. The choice to use only narrative corpora was based on previous research which indicated it has the best ability to distinguish a language impairment in children. The first dataset consists of samples from British adolescents, the second from Canadian children aged 4 to 9, and the third from U.S. children aged 4 to 12.
Unfortunately finding transcript data of this kind is rare, I have tried to find more data to no avail, so 1163 samples will have to do.
Conti-Ramsden 4:
The Conti-Ramsden 4 dataset was collected for a study to assess the effectiveness of narrative tests on adolescents. It consists of 99 TD and 19 SLI samples of children between the ages of 13.10 and 15.90. Ideally all the corpora would only be from children, as SLI is most prominent in children aged five years old, and is best detected early. However, it was included to enable a direct comparison between classifiers created by Gabani and this study.
The corpus contains transcripts of a story telling task based on Mayer‚Äôs wordless picture book ‚ÄúFrog, Where Are You‚Äù. The children first viewed the picture book in their own time before being prompted to retell the story in the past tense. If the children started telling the story in the present tense the interviewer would prompt them with the phrase ‚ÄúWhat happened next?‚Äù in order to attempt to revert them back to the past tense. If they failed to start to retell the story in the past tense after two prompts no further prompts were made.
ENNI
The ENNI dataset was collected during the course of a study aimed at identifying SLI children using an index of storytelling ability based on the story grammar model. The corpus consists of 300 TD and 77 SLI samples of children aged between 4 and 9 years old. Each child was presented with two wordless picture stories with one more complicated than the other. Unlike Conti-Ramsden 4 the examiner held the book and turned the page after the child appeared to be finished telling the story for a particular picture. The children were also given the opportunity to practice on a training story, where the examiner gave more explicit prompts to the child about what to do.
Gillam
The Gillam dataset is based on another tool for narrative assessment known as ‚ÄúThe Test of Narrative Language (TNL). It consists of 250 language impaired children, and 520 controls aged between 5 and 12. A detailed description of each of the participants does not exist. The TNL consists of four storytelling tasks, the first is a recall of a script based story, the rest being wordless picture books. The first picture set depicts a story with a main protagonist having repeated attempts at the goal, and the rest are single picture stories. The single picture stories require more input from the child, and thus is better suited to older children. The TNL appears to be intermediary in difficulty compared to ENNI.

Past Research
I have spent the last few months playing around with this data, I have uploaded it here mainly to speed up the computation of the analysis I have already done. But I'm excited to see what other people can do with this. There are some nice graphs to be made; especially using the MLU attributes.
Thus far using the combined corpora the best I have managed to get in terms of creating a predictive classifier is using Neural Networks with Feature Extraction and SMOTE to get a mean ROC of 0.8709 under 10-repeated-10-k-folds CV. You'll find that Random Forest and SVM with an RBF kernel do comparably well with SMOTE.

AWS spot Instances allow users to bid on spare server capacity. You set a bid threshold for an instance that is usually upwards of 30% cheaper than standard on-demand AWS instances. You can save a lot of money with AWS spot instances.
Data Content
I pulled this data from the AWS CLI with the describe-spot-price-history command. I took a lot of time to acquire and transform, which is why I decided to provide it here.
There are various time periods per region (I acquired all that I could). The columns are all fairly self-evident. Please comment if you have any questions about the data or columns.
The data includes the following column fields:
price: the current Spot price
datetime: the date and time
instance_type: the Spot instance type
os: the Spot instance operating system
region: the region and availability zone (AZ) for the Spot instance
Inspiration
While AWS spot instances are significantly cheaper than on-demand instances, there is only one problem with spot instances: once the spot market price of an instance exceeds the bid threshold you purchased an instance for, the instance is terminated and given to others with higher bids. So while hourly server costs are cheaper, your server is liable to terminate without notice. But, there is a difference between regions and spot pricing. Sometimes there is an arbitrage between regions, and some regions have more stable prices than others (fewer price spikes). If you can find which region/AZ is most stable, you can worry less about your instance terminating without notice.
I started collecting this data because I wanted answers to two questions:
Which region/AZ is historically cheapest for instance X
Which region/AZ is historically most stable for instance X
We could also use this data to predict which regions are likely to stay under a certain $ Spot price, which would allow you to say with some amount of certainty whether a SPOT instance lasts the next [6,12,18]+ hours."

This dataset contains oceanographic and surface meteorological readings taken from a series of buoys positioned throughout the equatorial Pacific. This data was collected with the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) array, which consists of nearly 70 moored buoys spanning the equatorial Pacific, measuring oceanographic and surface meteorological variables critical for improved detection, understanding and prediction of seasonal-to-interannual climate variations originating in the tropics.
Content
The data consists of the following variables: date, latitude, longitude, zonal winds (west<0, east>0), meridional winds (south<0, north>0), relative humidity, air temperature, sea surface temperature and subsurface temperatures down to a depth of 500 meters. Data taken from the buoys from as early as 1980 for some locations. Other data that was taken in various locations are rainfall, solar radiation, current levels, and subsurface temperatures.
The latitude and longitude in the data showed that the bouys moved around to different locations. The latitude values stayed within a degree from the approximate location. Yet the longitude values were sometimes as far as five degrees off of the approximate location.
There are missing values in the data. Not all buoys are able to measure currents, rainfall, and solar radiation, so these values are missing dependent on the individual buoy. The amount of data available is also dependent on the buoy, as certain buoys were commissioned earlier than others.
All readings were taken at the same time of day.

Abstract
(from original paper)
Natural disasters pose serious threats to large urban areas, therefore understanding and predicting human movements is critical for evaluating a population‚Äôs vulnerability and resilience and developing plans for disaster evacuation, response and relief. However, only limited research has been conducted into the effect of natural disasters on human mobility. This study examines how natural disasters influence human mobility patterns in urban populations using individuals‚Äô movement data collected from Twitter. We selected fifteen destructive cases across five types of natural disaster and analyzed the human movement data before, during, and after each event, comparing the perturbed and steady state movement data. The results suggest that the power-law can describe human mobility in most cases and that human mobility patterns observed in steady states are often correlated with those in perturbed states, highlighting their inherent resilience. However, the quantitative analysis shows that this resilience has its limits and can fail in more powerful natural disasters. The findings from this study will deepen our understanding of the interaction between urban dwellers and civil infrastructure, improve our ability to predict human movement patterns during natural disasters, and facilitate contingency planning by policymakers.

Dalia Research conducted the first representative poll on basic income across Europe in the Spring of 2016. The results, first presented together with NEOPOLIS at the Future of Work conference in Zurich, showed that two thirds of Europeans would vote for basic income. Dalia's basic income poll is now an annual survey, and the first wave of results from 2016 are now being made public. Although Dalia's latest research on basic income is not yet public, you can visit here to see the results from the most recent Spring 2017 survey.
The study was conducted by Dalia Research in April 2016 on public opinion across 28 EU Member States. The sample of n=9.649 was drawn across all 28 EU Member States, taking into account current population distributions with regard to age (14-65 years), gender and region/country.

Word embeddings define the similarity between two words by the normalised inner product of their vectors. The matrices in this repository place languages in a single space, without changing any of these monolingual similarity relationships. When you use the resulting multilingual vectors for monolingual tasks, they will perform exactly the same as the original vectors.
Facebook recently open-sourced word vectors in 89 languages. However these vectors are monolingual; meaning that while similar words within a language share similar vectors, translation words from different languages do not have similar vectors. In this dataset are 78 matrices, which can be used to align the majority of the fastText languages in a single space.
Contents:
This repository contains 78 matrices, which can be used to align the majority of the fastText languages in a single space.
This dataset was obtained by first getting the 10,000 most common words in the English fastText vocabulary, and then using the Google Translate API to translate these words into the 78 languages available. This vocabulary was then split in two, assigning the first 5000 words to the training dictionary, and the second 5000 to the test dictionary. The alignment procedure is discribed in this blog. It takes two sets of word vectors and a small bilingual dictionary of translation pairs in two languages; and generates a matrix which aligns the source language with the target. Sometimes Google translates an English word to a non-English phrase, in these cases we average the word vectors contained in the phrase. To place all 78 languages in a single space, every matrix is aligned to the English vectors (the English matrix is the identity). You can find more information on this dataset in the authors‚Äô GitHub repository, here.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics defines the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as ‚Äúa statistical measure of change, over time, of the prices of goods and services in major expenditure groups--such as food, housing, apparel, transportation, and medical care--typically purchased by urban consumers. Essentially, it compares the cost of a sample of goods and services in a specific month relative to the cost of the same ""market basket"" in an earlier reference period.
Make sure to read the cu.txt for more descriptive summaries on each data file and how to use the unique identifiers.
Content:
This dataset was collected June 27th, 2017 and may not be up-to-date.
The revised CPI introduced by the BLS in 1998 includes indexes for two populations; urban wage earners and clerical workers (CW), and all urban consumers (CU). This dataset covers all urban consumers (CU).
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a statistical measure of change, over time, of the prices of goods and services in major expenditure groups--such as food, housing, apparel, transportation, and medical care--typically purchased by urban consumers. Essentially, it compares the cost of a sample ""market basket"" of goods and services in a specific month relative to the cost of the same ""market basket"" in an earlier reference period. This reference period is designated as the base period.
As a result of the 1998 revision, both the CW and the CU utilize updated expenditure weights based upon data tabulated from three years (1982, 1983, and 1984) of the Consumer Expenditure Survey and incorporate a number of technical improvements, including an updated and revised item structure.
To construct the two indexes, prices for about 100,000 items and data on about 8,300 housing units are collected in a sample of 91 urban places. Comparison of indexes for individual CMSA's or cities show only the relative change over time in prices between locations. These indexes cannot be used to measure interarea differences in price levels or living costs.
Summary Data Available: U.S. average indexes for both populations are available for about 305 consumer items and groups of items. In addition, over 100 of the indexes have been adjusted for seasonality. The indexes are monthly with some beginning in 1913. Semi-annual indexes have been calculated for about 100 items for comparison with semi-annual areas mentioned below. Semi-annual indexes are available from 1984 forward.
Area indexes for both populations are available for 26 urban places. For each area, indexes are published for about 42 items and groups. The indexes are published monthly for three areas, bimonthly for eleven areas, and semi-annually for 12 urban areas.
Regional indexes for both populations are available for four regions with about 55 items and groups per region. Beginning with January 1987, indexes are monthly, with some beginning as early as 1966. Semi-annual indexes have been calculated for about 42 items for comparison with semi-annual areas mentioned above. Semi-annual indexes have been calculated for about 42 items in the 27 urban places for comparison with semi-annual areas.
City-size indexes for both populations are available for three size classes with about 55 items and groups per class. Beginning with January 1987, indexes are monthly and most begin in 1977. Semi-annual indexes have been calculated for about 42 items for comparison with semi-annual areas mentioned below.
Region/city-size indexes for both populations are available cross classified by region and city-size class. For each of 13 cross calculations, about 42 items and groups are available. Beginning with January 1987, indexes are monthly and most begin in 1977. Semi-annual indexes have been calculated for about 42 items in the 26 urban places for comparison with semi-annual areas.
Frequency of Observations: U.S. city average indexes, some area indexes, and regional indexes, city-size indexes, and region/city-size indexes for both populations are monthly. Other area indexes for both populations are bimonthly or semi-annual.
Annual Averages: Annual averages are available for all unadjusted series in the CW and CU.
Base Periods: Most indexes have a base period of 1982-1984 = 100. Other indexes, mainly those which have been added to the CPI program with the 1998 revision, are based more recently. The base period value is 100.0, except for the ""Purchasing Power"" values (AAOR and SAOR) where the base period value is 1.000.
Data Characteristics: Indexes are stored to one decimal place, except for the ""Purchasing Power"" values which are stored to three decimal places.

Health care in the United States is provided by many distinct organizations. Health care facilities are largely owned and operated by private sector businesses. 58% of US community hospitals are non-profit, 21% are government owned, and 21% are for-profit. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the United States spent more on healthcare per capita ($9,403), and more on health care as percentage of its GDP (17.1%), than any other nation in 2014. Many different datasets are needed to portray different aspects of healthcare in US like disease prevalences, pharmaceuticals and drugs, Nutritional data of different food products available in US. Such data is collected by surveys (or otherwise) conducted by Centre of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Foods and Drugs Administration, Center of Medicare and Medicaid Services and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). These datasets can be used to properly review demographics and diseases, determining start ratings of healthcare providers, different drugs and their compositions as well as package informations for different diseases and for food quality. We often want such information and finding and scraping such data can be a huge hurdle. So, Here an attempt is made to make available all US healthcare data at one place to download from in csv files.

Nhanes Survey (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) - The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The survey is unique in that it combines interviews and physical examinations. NHANES is a major program of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). NCHS is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and has the responsibility for producing vital and health statistics for the Nation. The NHANES interview includes demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health-related questions. The examination component consists of medical, dental, and physiological measurements, as well as laboratory tests administered by highly trained medical personnel. The diseases, medical conditions, and health indicators to be studied include: Anemia, Cardiovascular disease, Diabetes, Environmental exposures, Eye diseases, Hearing loss, Infectious diseases, Kidney disease, Nutrition, Obesity, Oral health, Osteoporosis, Physical fitness and physical functioning, Reproductive history and sexual behavior, Respiratory disease (asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema), Sexually transmitted diseases, Vision. 10000 individuals are surveyed to represent US statistics.

Charlottesville is home to a statue of Robert E. Lee which is slated to be removed. (For those unfamiliar with American history, Robert E. Lee was a US Army general who defected to the Confederacy during the American Civil War and was considered to be one of their best military leaders.) While many Americans support the move, believing the main purpose of the Confederacy was to defend the institution of slavery, many others do not share this view. Furthermore, believing Confederate symbols to be merely an expression of Southern pride, many have not taken its planned removal lightly.
As a result, many people--including white nationalists and neo-Nazis--have descended to Charlottesville to protest its removal. This in turn attracted many counter-protestors. Tragically, one of the counter-protestors--Heather Heyer--was killed and many others injured after a man intentionally rammed his car into them. In response, President Trump blamed ""both sides"" for the chaos in Charlottesville, leading many Americans to denounce him for what they see as a soft-handed approach to what some have called an act of ""domestic terrorism.""
This dataset below captures the discussion--and copious amounts of anger--revolving around this past week's events.
The Data
Description
This data set consists of a random sample of 50,000 tweets per day (in accordance with the Twitter Developer Agreement) of tweets mentioning Charlottesville or containing ""#charlottesville"" extracted via the Twitter Streaming API, starting on August 15. The files were copied from a large Postgres database containing--currently--over 2 million tweets. Finally, a table of tweet counts per timestamp was created using the whole database (not just the Kaggle sample). The data description PDF provides a full summary of the attributes found in the CSV files.
Note: While the tweet timestamps are in UTC, the cutoffs were based on Eastern Standard Time, so the August 16 file will have timestamps ranging from 2017-08-16 4:00:00 UTC to 2017-08-17 4:00:00 UTC.
Format
The dataset is available as either separate CSV files or a single SQLite database.
License
I'm releasing the dataset under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license. Furthermore, because this data was extracted via the Twitter Streaming API, its use must abide by the Twitter Developer Agreement. Most notably, the display of individual tweets should satisfy these requirements. More information can be found in the data description file, or on Twitter's website.
Acknowledgements
Obviously, I would like to thank Twitter for providing a fast and reliable streaming service. I'd also like to thank the developers of the Python programming language, psycopg2, and Postgres for creating amazing software with which this data set would not exist.

I almost removed the header ""inspiration"" from this section, because this is a rather sad and dark data set. However, this is preciously why this is an important data set to analyze. Good history books have never shied away from unpleasant events, and never should we.
This data set provides a rich opportunity for many types of research, including:
Natural language processing
Sentiment analysis
Data visualization
Furthermore, given the political nature of this dataset, there are a lot of social science questions that can potentially be answered, or at least piqued, by this data."

There are over 7,000 human languages in the world. The World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) contains information on the structure of 2,679 of them. It also includes information about where languages are used. WALS is widely-cited and used in the linguistics research community.
Content:
The World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) is a large database of structural (phonological, grammatical, lexical) properties of languages gathered from descriptive materials (such as reference grammars) by a team of 55 authors. The atlas provides information on the location, linguistic affiliation and basic typological features of a great number of the world's languages

This is a set of just over 20,000 games collected from a selection of users on the site Lichess.org, and how to collect more. I will also upload more games in the future as I collect them. This set contains the:
Game ID;
Rated (T/F);
Start Time;
End Time;

Time Increment;
White Player ID;
White Player Rating;
Black Player ID;
Black Player Rating;
All Moves in Standard Chess Notation;
Opening Eco (Standardised Code for any given opening, list here);
Opening Name;
Opening Ply (Number of moves in the opening phase)
For each of these separate games from Lichess. I collected this data using the Lichess API, which enables collection of any given users game history. The difficult part was collecting usernames to use, however the API also enables dumping of all users in a Lichess team. There are several teams on Lichess with over 1,500 players, so this proved an effective way to get users to collect games from.
Possible Uses
Lots of information is contained within a single chess game, let alone a full dataset of multiple games. It is primarily a game of patterns, and data science is all about detecting patterns in data, which is why chess has been one of the most invested in areas of AI in the past. This dataset collects all of the information available from 20,000 games and presents it in a format that is easy to process for analysis of, for example, what allows a player to win as black or white, how much meta (out-of-game) factors affect a game, the relationship between openings and victory for black and white and more."

Identification of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) during the post-marketing phase is one of the most important goals of drug safety surveillance. Spontaneous reporting systems (SRS) data, which are the mainstay of traditional drug safety surveillance, are used for hypothesis generation and to validate the newer approaches. The publicly available US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) data requires substantial curation before they can be used appropriately, and applying different strategies for data cleaning and normalization can have material impact on analysis results.
Content:
We provide a curated and standardized version of FAERS removing duplicate case records, applying standardized vocabularies with drug names mapped to RxNorm concepts and outcomes mapped to SNOMED-CT concepts, and pre-computed summary statistics about drug-outcome relationships for general consumption. This publicly available resource, along with the source code, will accelerate drug safety research by reducing the amount of time spent performing data management on the source FAERS reports, improving the quality of the underlying data, and enabling standardized analyses using common vocabularies.

Abstract: Surveys for more than 9,500 households were conducted in the growing seasons 2002/2003 or 2003/2004 in eleven African countries: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ghana, Niger and Senegal in western Africa; Egypt in northern Africa; Ethiopia and Kenya in eastern Africa; South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe in southern Africa. Households were chosen randomly in districts that are representative for key agro-climatic zones and farming systems. The data set specifies farming systems characteristics that can help inform about the importance of each system for a country‚Äôs agricultural production and its ability to cope with short- and long-term climate changes or extreme weather events. Further it informs about the location of smallholders and vulnerable systems and permits benchmarking agricultural systems characteristics.
Content
The data file contains survey data collected from different families and has 9597 rows that represent the households and 1753 columns with details about the households. The questionnaire was organized into seven sections and respondents were asked to relate the information provided to the previous 12 months‚Äô farming season. There are too many columns to describe here, however they are described in detail in this paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201620?WT.ec_id=SDATA-201605

I wanted to find a better way to provide live traffic updates. We dont all have access to the data from traffic monitoring sensors or whatever gets uploaded from people's smart phones to Apple, Google etc plus I question how accurate the traffic congestion is on Google Maps or other apps. So I figured that since buses are also in the same traffic and many buses stream their GPS location and other data live, that would be an ideal source for traffic data. I investigated the data streams available from many bus companies around the world and found MTA in NYC to be very reliable.
Content
This dataset is from the NYC MTA buses data stream service. In roughly 10 minute increments the bus location, route, bus stop and more is included in each row. The scheduled arrival time from the bus schedule is also included, to give an indication of where the bus should be (how much behind schedule, or on time, or even ahead of schedule).
Data for the entire month of June 2017 is included.
Due to space limitations on Kaggle for datasets, only selected bus routes have been included.

international relations",CSV,326 KB,Other,"4,396 views",434 downloads,7 kernels,,https://www.kaggle.com/jmataya/missingmigrants,"About the Missing Migrants Data
This data is sourced from the International Organization for Migration. The data is part of a specific project called the Missing Migrants Project which tracks deaths of migrants, including refugees , who have gone missing along mixed migration routes worldwide. The research behind this project began with the October 2013 tragedies, when at least 368 individuals died in two shipwrecks near the Italian island of Lampedusa. Since then, Missing Migrants Project has developed into an important hub and advocacy source of information that media, researchers, and the general public access for the latest information.
Where is the data from?
Missing Migrants Project data are compiled from a variety of sources. Sources vary depending on the region and broadly include data from national authorities, such as Coast Guards and Medical Examiners; media reports; NGOs; and interviews with survivors of shipwrecks. In the Mediterranean region, data are relayed from relevant national authorities to IOM field missions, who then share it with the Missing Migrants Project team. Data are also obtained by IOM and other organizations that receive survivors at landing points in Italy and Greece. In other cases, media reports are used. IOM and UNHCR also regularly coordinate on such data to ensure consistency. Data on the U.S./Mexico border are compiled based on data from U.S. county medical examiners and sheriff‚Äôs offices, as well as media reports for deaths occurring on the Mexico side of the border. Estimates within Mexico and Central America are based primarily on media and year-end government reports. Data on the Bay of Bengal are drawn from reports by UNHCR and NGOs. In the Horn of Africa, data are obtained from media and NGOs. Data for other regions is drawn from a combination of sources, including media and grassroots organizations. In all regions, Missing Migrants Projectdata represents minimum estimates and are potentially lower than in actuality.
Updated data and visuals can be found here: https://missingmigrants.iom.int/
Who is included in Missing Migrants Project data?
IOM defines a migrant as any person who is moving or has moved across an international border or within a State away from his/her habitual place of residence, regardless of
    (1) the person‚Äôs legal status; 
    (2) whether the movement is voluntary or involuntary; 
    (3) what the causes for the movement are; or 
    (4) what the length of the stay is.[1]
Missing Migrants Project counts migrants who have died or gone missing at the external borders of states, or in the process of migration towards an international destination. The count excludes deaths that occur in immigration detention facilities, during deportation, or after forced return to a migrant‚Äôs homeland, as well as deaths more loosely connected with migrants‚Äô irregular status, such as those resulting from labour exploitation. Migrants who die or go missing after they are established in a new home are also not included in the data, so deaths in refugee camps or housing are excluded. This approach is chosen because deaths that occur at physical borders and while en route represent a more clearly definable category, and inform what migration routes are most dangerous. Data and knowledge of the risks and vulnerabilities faced by migrants in destination countries, including death, should not be neglected, rather tracked as a distinct category.
How complete is the data on dead and missing migrants?
Data on fatalities during the migration process are challenging to collect for a number of reasons, most stemming from the irregular nature of migratory journeys on which deaths tend to occur. For one, deaths often occur in remote areas on routes chosen with the explicit aim of evading detection. Countless bodies are never found, and rarely do these deaths come to the attention of authorities or the media. Furthermore, when deaths occur at sea, frequently not all bodies are recovered - sometimes with hundreds missing from one shipwreck - and the precise number of missing is often unknown. In 2015, over 50 per cent of deaths recorded by the Missing Migrants Project refer to migrants who are presumed dead and whose bodies have not been found, mainly at sea.
Data are also challenging to collect as reporting on deaths is poor, and the data that does exist are highly scattered. Few official sources are collecting data systematically. Many counts of death rely on media as a source. Coverage can be spotty and incomplete. In addition, the involvement of criminal actors in incidents means there may be fear among survivors to report deaths and some deaths may be actively covered-up. The irregular immigration status of many migrants, and at times their families as well, also impedes reporting of missing persons or deaths.
The varying quality and comprehensiveness of data by region in attempting to estimate deaths globally may exaggerate the share of deaths that occur in some regions, while under-representing the share occurring in others.
What can be understood through this data?
The available data can give an indication of changing conditions and trends related to migration routes and the people travelling on them, which can be relevant for policy making and protection plans. Data can be useful to determine the relative risks of irregular migration routes. For example, Missing Migrants Project data show that despite the increase in migrant flows through the eastern Mediterranean in 2015, the central Mediterranean remained the more deadly route. In 2015, nearly two people died out of every 100 travellers (1.85%) crossing the Central route, as opposed to one out of every 1,000 that crossed from Turkey to Greece (0.095%). From the data, we can also get a sense of whether groups like women and children face additional vulnerabilities on migration routes.
However, it is important to note that because of the challenges in data collection for the missing and dead, basic demographic information on the deceased is rarely known. Often migrants in mixed migration flows do not carry appropriate identification. When bodies are found it may not be possible to identify them or to determine basic demographic information. In the data compiled by Missing Migrants Project, sex of the deceased is unknown in over 80% of cases. Region of origin has been determined for the majority of the deceased. Even this information is at times extrapolated based on available information ‚Äì for instance if all survivors of a shipwreck are of one origin it was assumed those missing also came from the same region.
The Missing Migrants Project dataset includes coordinates for where incidents of death took place, which indicates where the risks to migrants may be highest. However, it should be noted that all coordinates are estimates.
Why collect data on missing and dead migrants?
By counting lives lost during migration, even if the result is only an informed estimate, we at least acknowledge the fact of these deaths. What before was vague and ill-defined is now a quantified tragedy that must be addressed. Politically, the availability of official data is important. The lack of political commitment at national and international levels to record and account for migrant deaths reflects and contributes to a lack of concern more broadly for the safety and well-being of migrants, including asylum-seekers. Further, it drives public apathy, ignorance, and the dehumanization of these groups.
Data are crucial to better understand the profiles of those who are most at risk and to tailor policies to better assist migrants and prevent loss of life. Ultimately, improved data should contribute to efforts to better understand the causes, both direct and indirect, of fatalities and their potential links to broader migration control policies and practices.
Counting and recording the dead can also be an initial step to encourage improved systems of identification of those who die. Identifying the dead is a moral imperative that respects and acknowledges those who have died. This process can also provide a some sense of closure for families who may otherwise be left without ever knowing the fate of missing loved ones.
Identification and tracing of the dead and missing
As mentioned above, the challenge remains to count the numbers of dead and also identify those counted. Globally, the majority of those who die during migration remain unidentified. Even in cases in which a body is found identification rates are low. Families may search for years or a lifetime to find conclusive news of their loved one. In the meantime, they may face psychological, practical, financial, and legal problems.
Ultimately Missing Migrants Project would like to see that every unidentified body, for which it is possible to recover, is adequately ‚Äúmanaged‚Äù, analysed and tracked to ensure proper documentation, traceability and dignity. Common forensic protocols and standards should be agreed upon, and used within and between States. Furthermore, data relating to the dead and missing should be held in searchable and open databases at local, national and international levels to facilitate identification.
For more in-depth analysis and discussion of the numbers of missing and dead migrants around the world, and the challenges involved in identification and tracing, read our two reports on the issue, Fatal Journeys: Tracking Lives Lost during Migration (2014) and Fatal Journeys Volume 2, Identification and Tracing of Dead and Missing Migrants

Established in 1951, IOM is the leading inter-governmental organization in the field of migration and works closely with governmental, intergovernmental and non-governmental partners.
With 166 member states, a further 8 states holding observer status and offices in over 100 countries, IOM is dedicated to promoting humane and orderly migration for the benefit of all. It does so by providing services and advice to governments and migrants.
IOM works to help ensure the orderly and humane management of migration, to promote international cooperation on migration issues, to assist in the search for practical solutions to migration problems and to provide humanitarian assistance to migrants in need, including refugees and internally displaced people.
The IOM Constitution recognizes the link between migration and economic, social and cultural development, as well as to the right of freedom of movement.
IOM works in the four broad areas of migration management:
Migration and development
Facilitating migration
Regulating migration
Forced migration.
IOM activities that cut across these areas include the promotion of international migration law, policy debate and guidance, protection of migrants' rights, migration health and the gender dimension of migration.

Age-adjusted Death Rates for Selected Major Causes of Death: United States, 1900-2013
Age adjusting rates
is a way to make fairer comparisons between groups with different age distributions. For example, a county having a higher percentage of elderly people may have a higher rate of death or hospitalization than a county with a younger population, merely because the elderly are more likely to die or be hospitalized. (The same distortion can happen when comparing races, genders, or time periods.) Age adjustment can make the different groups more comparable. A ""standard"" population distribution is used to adjust death and hospitalization rates. The age-adjusted rates are rates that would have existed if the population under study had the same age distribution as the ""standard"" population. Therefore, they are summary measures adjusted for differences in age distributions.

This dataset contains information on pesticide residues in food. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) conducts the Pesticide Data Program (PDP) every year to help assure consumers that the food they feed themselves and their families is safe. Ultimately, if EPA determines a pesticide is not safe for human consumption, it is removed from the market.
The PDP tests a wide variety of domestic and imported foods, with a strong focus on foods that are consumed by infants and children. EPA relies on PDP data to conduct dietary risk assessments and to ensure that any pesticide residues in foods remain at safe levels. USDA uses the data to better understand the relationship of pesticide residues to agricultural practices and to enhance USDA‚Äôs Integrated Pest Management objectives. USDA also works with U.S. growers to improve agricultural practices.

TIME's Person of the Year hasn't always secured his or her place in the history books, but many honorees remain unforgettable: Gandhi, Khomeini, Kennedy, Elizabeth II, the Apollo 8 astronauts Anders, Borman and Lovell. Each has left an indelible mark on the world.
TIME's choices for Person of the Year are often controversial. Editors are asked to choose the person or thing that had the greatest impact on the news, for good or ill ‚Äî guidelines that leave them no choice but to select a newsworthy, not necessarily praiseworthy, cover subject. Controversial choices have included Adolf Hitler (1938), Joseph Stalin (1939, 1942), and Ayatullah Khomeini (1979).
TIME's choices for Person of the Year are often politicians and statesmen. Eleven American presidents, from FDR to George W. Bush, have graced the Person of the Year cover, many of them more than once. As commander in chief of one of the world's greatest nations, it's hard not to be a newsmaker.
Content
This dataset includes a record for every Time Magazine cover which has honored an individual or group as ""Men of the Year"", ""Women of the Year"", or (as of 1999) ""Person of the Year"".

This dataset provides a collection of vital signals and reference blood pressure values acquired from 26 subjects that can be used for the purpose of non-invasive cuff-less blood pressure estimation.
Source
Creators: Amirhossein Esmaili, Mohammad Kachuee, Mahdi Shabany Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran Date: October 2017
Relevant Information
This dataset is to be used for research methods trying to estimate blood pressure in a cuff-less non-invasive manner. For each subject in this dataset, phonocardiogram (PCG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals are acquired. Alongside the acquisition of the signals per subject, a number of reference BPs are measured. Here, a signal from a force-sensing resistor (FSR), placed under the cuff of the BP reference device, is used to distinguish exact moments of reference BP measurements, which are corresponding to the inflation and deflation of the cuff. The signal from FSR is also included in our dataset. For each subject, age, weight, and height are also recorded.
Attribute Information
In the dataset, corresponding to each subject there is a ‚Äú.json‚Äù file. In each file, we have the following attributes:
‚ÄúUID‚Äù: Subject number
‚Äúage‚Äù: Age of the subject
‚Äúweight‚Äù: Weight of the subject (Kg)
‚Äúheight‚Äù: Height of the subject (cm)
‚Äúdata_PCG‚Äù: Acquired PCG signal from chest (Fs = 1 KHz)
‚Äúdata_ECG‚Äù: Acquired ECG signal (Fs = 1 KHz)
‚Äúdata_PPG‚Äù: Acquired PPG signal from fingertip (Fs = 1 KHz)
‚Äúdata_FSR‚Äù: Acquired FSR signal (Fs = 1 KHz)
‚Äúdata_BP‚Äù: reference systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values acquired from the subjects. To distinguish the time instances in the signals in which SBP and DBP values are measured, FSR signal can be used. For more details, please refer to our paper.
Please note that the FSR signal should be inverted prior to any analysis to reflect the instantaneous cuff pressure. Also, the moment of each reference device measurement is approximately the time at which the cuff pressure drops with a considerable negative slope.

Horse Racing in HK,Data on thoroughbred racing in Hong Kong for fun and machine learning,Graham Daley,18,"Version 2,2016-12-15|Version 1,2016-12-14",horse racing,CSV,11 MB,CC0,"7,828 views",873 downloads,20 kernels,2 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/gdaley/hkracing,"Can you beat the market?
Horse racing has always intrigued me - not so much from the point of view as a sport, but more from the view of it as a money market. Inspired by the pioneers of computerised horse betting, I'm sharing this dataset in the hope of finding more data scientists willing to take up the challenge and find new ways of exploiting it!
As always, the goal for most of us is to find information in the data that can be used to generate profit, usually by finding information that has not already been considered by the other players in the game. But I'm always interested in finding new uses for the data, whatever they may be.
Horse racing is a huge business in Hong Kong, which has two race tracks in a city that is only 1,104 square km. The betting pools are bigger than all US racetracks combined, which means that the opportunity is unlimited for those who are successful.
So are you up for it?

Unfortunately, like the sticks in the mikado game, sometime a chromosome or more can fall on an other one yielding overlapping chromosomes in the image, the plague of cytogeneticists. Before computers and images processing with photography, chromosomes were cut from a paper picture and then classified (at least two paper pictures were required), with computers and quantitative analysis, automatic methods were developped to overcome this problem (Lunsteen & Piper, Minaee et al.)
This dataset modelizes overlapping chromosomes. Couples of non overlapping chromosomes were combined by relative translations and rotations to generate two kind of images:
a grey scaled image of the two overlapping chromosomes combining a DAPI stained chromosome and the labelling of the telomeres (showing the chromosomes extremities)
a label image (the ground truth) were the value equal to 3 labels the pixels (displayed in red) belonging to the overlapping domain.
The images were saved in a numpy array as an hdf5 file. The following minimalist python 2 code can load the data (assuming that the unzipped data are in the same folder than the code) :
import h5py
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

#h5f = h5py.File('overlapping_chromosomes_examples.h5','r')

The Brazilian Government House of Representatives maintains a public database, that contains legislative information since 1970. One type of information that is available are the records of bills. For each bill, the database gives a list of votes choices, state and party of each deputy, and a list of details about the bill itself like type, year, text of proposal, benches orientations and situation (a bill can be voted more than one time, in this work we will treat each votation as a single one). We retrieved more than 100000 bills (propList), where less than 1% was voted (propVotList) until November 2016.
Our objective is detect regularity patterns of legislative behavior, institutional arrangements, and legislative outcome.

A long-term smartphone sensor dataset with a high temporal resolution. The dataset also offers explicit labels capturing the to activity of malwares running on the devices. The dataset currently contains 10 billion data records from 30 users collected over a period of 2 years and an additional 20 users for 10 months (totaling 50 active users currently participating in the experiment).
The primary purpose of the dataset is to help security professionals and academic researchers in developing innovative methods of implicitly detecting malicious behavior in smartphones. Specifically, from data obtainable without superuser (root) privileges. However, this dataset can be used for research in domains that are not strictly security related. For example, context aware recommender systems, event prediction, user personalization and awareness, location prediction, and more. The dataset also offers opportunities that aren't available in other datasets. For example, the dataset contains the SSID and signal strength of the connected WiFi access point (AP) which is sampled once every second, over the course of many months.

Google Trends data allows us to see what people are searching for at a very local level. This visualization tracks the top searches for common health issues in the United States, from Cancer to Diabetes, and compares them with the actual location of occurrences for those same health conditions to understand how search data reflects life for millions of Americans.
How does search interest for top health issues change over time? From 2004‚Äì2017, the data shows that search interest gradually increased over the past few years. Certain regions show a more significant increase in search interest than others. The increase in search activity is greatest in the Midwest and Northeast, while the changes are noticeably less dramatic in California, Texas, and Idaho. Are people generally becoming more aware of health conditions and health risks?
The search interest data was collected using the Google Trends API. The visualisation also brings in incidences of each condition so they can be compared. The health conditions were hand-selected from the Community Health Status Indicators (CHSI) which provides key indicators for local communities in the United States. The CHSI dataset includes more than 200 measures for each of the 3,141 United States counties. More information about the CHSI can be found on healthdata.gov.
Many striking similarities exist between searches and actual conditions‚Äîbut the relationship between the Obesity and Diabetes maps stands out the most. ‚ÄúThere are many risk factors for type 2 diabetes such as age, race, pregnancy, stress, certain medications, genetics or family history, high cholesterol and obesity. However, the single best predictor of type 2 diabetes is overweight or obesity. Almost 90% of people living with type 2 diabetes are overweight or have obesity. People who are overweight or have obesity have added pressure on their body's ability to use insulin to properly control blood sugar levels, and are therefore more likely to develop diabetes.‚Äù ‚ÄîObesity Society via obesity.org"

The data was collected using a Garmin Virb 1080p action camera. The shapes were cut from poster board, and then painted green. I held each shape in view of the camera for two minutes. While the camera was recording the shape, I moved the shape around and rotated it.
The four videos were then processed using OpenCV in Python. Using colorspaces, the green shape is cropped out of the image and resized to 200x200 pixels. The data is arranged into four folders; square, circle, triangle, and star. The images are labeled 0.png, 1.png, etc...
A fifth video was taken with all of the shapes in the frame. This fifth video is for testing purposes. The goal is to classify the shapes in the test video using a model created with the training data. These classifications were made using a model made in Keras.
How is this different than the MINST handwritten digits dataset? There are 10 classes in the MINST dataset and 4 in this shapes dataset. The images in this data set are rotated, and the digits in the MINST data set are not."

There are many kinds of birds: pigeons, ducks, ostriches, penguins... Some are good at flying, others can't fly but run fast. Some swim under water, others wading in shallow pool.
According to their living environments and living habits, birds are classified into different ecological groups. There are 8 ecological groups of birds:
Swimming Birds
Wading Birds
Terrestrial Birds
Raptors
Scansorial Birds
Singing Birds
Cursorial Birds (not included in dataset)
Marine Birds (not included in dataset)
First 6 groups are main and are covered by this dataset.
Apparently, birds belong to different ecological groups have different appearances: flying birds have strong wings and wading birds have long legs. Their living habits are somewhat reflected in their bones' shapes. As data scientists we may think of examining the underlying relationship between sizes of bones and ecological groups , and recognising birds' ecological groups by their bones' shapes.
Content
There are 420 birds contained in this dataset. Each bird is represented by 10 measurements (features):
Length and Diameter of Humerus
Length and Diameter of Ulna
Length and Diameter of Femur
Length and Diameter of Tibiotarsus
Length and Diameter of Tarsometatarsus
All measurements are continuous float numbers (mm) with missing values represented by empty strings. The skeletons of this dataset are collections of Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. They belong to 21 orders, 153 genera, 245 species.
Each bird has a label for its ecological group:

T: Terrestrial Birds
R: Raptors
P: Scansorial Birds
SO: Singing Birds

""The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time"" is a 2003 special issue of American magazine Rolling Stone, and a related book published in 2005. The lists presented were compiled based on votes from selected rock musicians, critics, and industry figures, and predominantly feature American and British music from the 1960s and the 1970s.
In 2012, Rolling Stone published a revised edition of the list drawing on the original and a later survey of albums in the 2000s. It was made available in ""bookazine"" format on newsstands in the US from April 27 to July 25. The new list contained 38 albums not present in the previous one, 16 of them released after 2003.
I took the albums from MusicBrainz but the genres weren't listed. I wrote a Python script to get the genres and subgenres of each album from the Discogs API.
The data collected are:
Position on the list
Year of release
Album name
Artist name
Genre name
Subgenre name
Some of the genres/subgenres may not be entirely correct - Discogs seems to not consider some of the smaller genres. Let me know if there are any glaring issues and I'll try to fix them."

The WTA (Women's Tennis Association) is the principal organizing body of women's professional tennis, it governs its own tour worldwide. On its website, it provides a lot of data about the players as individuals as well the tour matches with results and the current rank during it.
Luckily for us, Jeff Sackmann scraped the website and collected everything from there and put in a nice way into easily consumable datasets.
On Jeff's GitHub account you can find a lot more data about tennis!
Content
The dataset present here is directly downloaded from the source, no alteration on the data was made, the files were only placed in subdirectories so one can easily locate them.
It covers statistics of players registered on the WTA, the matches that happened on each tour by year, with results, as well some qualifying matches for the tours.
As a reminder, you may not find all data of the matches prior to 2006, so be warned when working with those sets.

The first seven columns are information about each settlement and voting booth, and from the eighth to the end is the number of votes each party has received in each booth.

Inspiration
Personally, I've viewed this dataset in order to map out the relationships between different parties (i.e which are 'closer', which are more 'central'). This question is significant in Israel, where the composition of the parliament is determined almost directly by the popular vote (e.g a party with 25% of the total proper votes will recieve 25% of seats in parliament), but the government is formed by a coalition of parties (so the head of the largest party in parliament will not necessarily be the Prime Minister)."

Context
The Stanford Mass Shootings in America (MSA) is a dataset released under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 international license by the Stanford Geospatial Center. While not an exhaustive collection of mass shootings, it is a high-quality dataset ranging from 1966 to 2016 with well-defined methodology, definitions and source URLs for user validation.
This dataset can be used to validate other datasets, such as us-mass-shootings-last-50-years, which contains more recent data, or conduct other analysis, as more information is provided.
Content
This dataset contains data by the MSA project both from it's website and from it's Github account. The difference between the two sources is only on the data format (i.e. .csv versus .geojson for the data, or .csv versus .pdf for the dictionary).

Note the data was reproduced here without any modifications other than file renaming for clarity, the content is the same as in the source.
The following sections are reproduced from the dataset creators website. For more details, please see the source.
Project background
The Stanford Mass Shootings of America (MSA) data project began in 2012, in reaction to the mass shooting in Sandy Hook, CT. In our initial attempts to map this phenomena it was determined that no comprehensive collection of these incidents existed online. The Stanford Geospatial Center set out to create, as best we could, a single point repository for as many mass shooting events as could be collected via online media. The result was the Stanford MSA.
What the Stanford MSA is
The Stanford MSA is a data aggregation effort. It is a curated set of spatial and temporal data about mass shootings in America, taken from online media sources. It is an attempt to facilitate research on gun violence in the US by making raw data more accessible.
What the Stanford MSA is not
The Stanford MSA is not a comprehensive, longitudinal research project. The data collected in the MSA are not investigated past the assessment for inclusion in the database. The MSA is not an attempt to answer specific questions about gun violence or gun laws.
The Stanford Geospatial Center does not provide analysis or commentary on the contents of this database or any derivatives produced with it.
Data collection methodology
The information collected for the Stanford MSA is limited to online resources. An initial intensive investigation was completed looking back over existing online reports to fill in the historic record going back to 1966. Contemporary records come in as new events occur and are cross referenced against a number of online reporting sources. In general a minimum of three corroborating sources are required to add the full record into the MSA (as many as 6 or 7 sources may have been consulted in many cases). All sources for each event are listed in the database.
Due to the time involved in vetting the details of any new incident, there is often a 2 to 4 week lag between a mass shooting event and its inclusion in the public release database.
It is important to note the records in the Stanford MSA span a time from well before the advent of online media reporting, through its infancy, to the modern era of web based news and information resources. Researchers using this database need to be aware of the reporting bias these changes in technology present. A spike in incidents for recent years is likely due to increased online reporting and not necessarily indicative of the rate of mass shootings alone. Researchers should look at this database as a curated collection of quality checked data regarding mass shootings, and not an exhaustive research data set itself. Independent verification and analysis will be required to use this data in examining trends in mass shootings over time.
Definition of Mass Shooting
The definition of mass shooting used for the Stanford database is 3 or more shooting victims (not necessarily fatalities), not including the shooter. The shooting must not be identifiably gang, drug, or organized crime related.

(a) What is the probability that a flight which is landing/taking off is ‚ÄúWN‚Äù Airlines (marginal probability) (b) What is the probability that a flight which is landing/taking off is either ‚ÄúWN‚Äù or ‚ÄúAA‚Äù Airlines (disjoint events) (c) What is the joint probability that a flight is both ‚ÄúWN‚Äù and travels less than 600 miles (joint probability) (d) What is the conditional probability that the flight travels less than 2500 miles given that the flight is ‚ÄúAA‚Äù Airlines (conditional probability) (e) What is the joint probability of a flight getting cancelled and is supposed to travel less than 2500 miles given that the flight is ‚ÄúAA‚Äù Airlines (joint + conditional probability)
(iii) Problem Statement
(a) Suppose arrival delays of flights belonging to ‚ÄúAA‚Äù are normally distributed with mean 15 minutes and standard deviation 3 minutes. If the ‚ÄúAA‚Äù plans to announce a scheme where it will give 50% cash back if their flights are delayed by 20 minutes, how much percentage of the trips ‚ÄúAA‚Äù is supposed to loose this money. (Hint: pnorm) (b) Assume that 65% of flights are diverted due to bad weather through the Weather System. What is the probability that in a random sample of 10 flights, 6 are diverted through the Weather System. (Hint: dbinorm) (c) Do linear regression between the Arrival Delay and Departure Delay of the flights. (d) Find out the confidence interval of the fitted linear regression line. (e) Perform a multiple linear regression between the Arrival Delay along with the Departure Delay and Distance travelled by flights."

GitHub is the leader in hosting open source projects. For those who are not familiar with open source projects, a group of developers share and contribute to common code to develop software. Example open source projects include, Chromium (which makes Google Chrome), WordPress, and Hadoop. Open source projects are said to have disrupted the software industry (2008 Kansas Keynote).
Content
For this study, I crawled the leader in hosting open source projects, GitHub.com and extracted a list of the top starred open source projects. On GitHub, a user may choose the star a repository representing that they ‚Äúlike‚Äù the project. For each project, I gathered the repository username or Organization the project resided in, the repository name, a description, the last updated date, the language of the project, the number of stars, any tags, and finally the url of the project.

This dataset features the salaries of 874 nhl players for the 2016/2017 season. I have randomly split the players into a training (612 players) and test (262 players) populations. There are 151 predictor columns (described in column legend section, if you're not familiar with hockey the meaning of some of these may be a bit cryptic!) as well as a leading column with the players 2016/2017 annual salary. For the test population the actual salaries have been broken off into a separate .csv file.

This data set is focused on WLAN fingerprint positioning technologies and methodologies (also know as WiFi Fingerprinting). It was the official database used in the IPIN2015 competition.
Many real world applications need to know the localization of a user in the world to provide their services. Therefore, automatic user localization has been a hot research topic in the last years. Automatic user localization consists of estimating the position of the user (latitude, longitude and altitude) by using an electronic device, usually a mobile phone. Outdoor localization problem can be solved very accurately thanks to the inclusion of GPS sensors into the mobile devices. However, indoor localization is still an open problem mainly due to the loss of GPS signal in indoor environments. Although, there are some indoor positioning technologies and methodologies, this database is focused on WLAN fingerprint-based ones (also know as WiFi Fingerprinting).
Although there are many papers in the literature trying to solve the indoor localization problem using a WLAN fingerprint-based method, there still exists one important drawback in this field which is the lack of a common database for comparison purposes. So, UJIIndoorLoc database is presented to overcome this gap.
The UJIIndoorLoc database covers three buildings of Universitat Jaume I (http://www.uji.es) with 4 or more floors and almost 110.000m2. It can be used for classification, e.g. actual building and floor identification, or regression, e.g. actual longitude and latitude estimation. It was created in 2013 by means of more than 20 different users and 25 Android devices. The database consists of 19937 training/reference records (trainingData.csv file) and 1111 validation/test records (validationData.csv file)
The 529 attributes contain the WiFi fingerprint, the coordinates where it was taken, and other useful information.
Each WiFi fingerprint can be characterized by the detected Wireless Access Points (WAPs) and the corresponding Received Signal Strength Intensity (RSSI). The intensity values are represented as negative integer values ranging -104dBm (extremely poor signal) to 0dbM. The positive value 100 is used to denote when a WAP was not detected. During the database creation, 520 different WAPs were detected. Thus, the WiFi fingerprint is composed by 520 intensity values.
Then the coordinates (latitude, longitude, floor) and Building ID are provided as the attributes to be predicted.
The particular space (offices, labs, etc.) and the relative position (inside/outside the space) where the capture was taken have been recorded. Outside means that the capture was taken in front of the door of the space.
Information about who (user), how (android device & version) and when (timestamp) WiFi capture was taken is also recorded.
Content
Attributes 001 to 520 (WAP001-WAP520): Intensity value for WAP001. Negative integer values from -104 to 0 and +100. Positive value 100 used if WAP001 was not detected.
Attribute 521 (Longitude): Longitude. Negative real values from -7695.9387549299299000 to -7299.786516730871000
Attribute 522 (Latitude): Latitude. Positive real values from 4864745.7450159714 to 4865017.3646842018.
Attribute 523 (Floor): Altitude in floors inside the building. Integer values from 0 to 4.
Attribute 524 (BuildingID): ID to identify the building. Measures were taken in three different buildings. Categorical integer values from 0 to 2.
Attribute 525 (SpaceID): Internal ID number to identify the Space (office, corridor, classroom) where the capture was taken. Categorical integer values.
Attribute 526 (RelativePosition): Relative position with respect to the Space (1 - Inside, 2 - Outside in Front of the door). Categorical integer values.
Attribute 527 (UserID): User identifier (see below). Categorical integer values.
Attribute 528 (PhoneID): Android device identifier (see below). Categorical integer values.

The objective is to estimate the building, floor and coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the 1111 samples included in the validation set. Since the real values of the building, floor and coordinates are also included, it is posible to determine the localization error.
The formula used in the IPIN2015 competition was the mean of the localization error of each sample. The localization error of each sample can be estimated as follows:
Error = building_penality * building_error + floor_penality * floor_error + coordinates_error
where:
building_error is 1 if the estimated building is not equal to the real one. 0 otherwise
floor_error is 1 if the estimated floor is not equal to the real one. 0 otherwise
coordinates_error is sqrt( (estimated_latitude - real_latitude)^2 + (estimated_longitude-real_longitude)^2)
In the IPIN2015 competition building_penalty and floor_penalty where set to 50 and 4 meters, respectively."

In the past, the ancient city of Krakow was known as the capital of Poland. In 2000, it became known as the official European Capital of Culture. Now, it is known for having some of the most polluted air in Europe... In a World Health Organiation (WHO) study Krakow has been rated amongst the most polluted in the world. In the report, city was ranked 8th among 575 cities for levels of PM2.5 and 145th among 1100 cities for levels of PM10. Hazardous air quality is a common problem particularly during the colder months when many residents use solid fuels (mostly coal) for household heating. Air pollution in Krakow poses a significant danger to human health and life. Krakow's poisoned air includes amongst other things: particulate matter, benzo(a)pyrene and nitrogen dioxide. The state-run network of monitoring stations consists of 8 monitoring stations in Krakow. We decided to go step further - to build network of low-cost air quality sensors that can be deployed across entire city. The first step in the fight against smog is to identify areas of problem and to raise awareness among residents and the authorities. It is very important to create a network of sensors ‚Äì only then you can check the actual conditions in various areas of the city. The technology enables real-time monitoring of air quality via map.airly.eu, so the information about the air in a specific location is easily accessible and always up to date.
Content
This dataset consists air quality data (the concentrations of particulate matter PM1, PM2.5 and PM10, temperature, air pressure and humidity) from 2017 generated by network of 56 low-cost sensors located in Krakow, Poland. Each had its own location (6 of them where replaced during this time period and have almost the same latitude and longitude). Measurements are grouped in 12 files, one for each month. Resolution of data is 1 hour.
Known issues: - PM1 is not calibrated and therefore can be bigger than PM2.5 - PM2.5 can be bigger than PM10 within the limits of measurement error - for the first two months humidity and temperature were not calibrated and therefore can show inaccurate values
Acknowledgements
The data was generated by Airly network - the project is still in its beginning stage, but over 1000 sensors have already been implemented in Poland. Airly is a startup definitely worth watching, especially for citizens of the most polluted cities. After all, it‚Äôs clean air we all want to breathe.
Inspiration
I think that this dataset offers some great opportunities for predictive models and data visualization. Airly's goal is to develop an effective forecast and monitoring of air quality, employ Artificial Intelligence and utilise data from extensive sensor network. If anyone has any ideas, breakthroughs or other interesting models please post them.
Some questions worth exploring: - What are the best prediction models based on extensive sensor network - statistical or numerical forecast? - How weather affects air quality? - How much pollution comes from cars, factories and coal-fired power plants?"

Experimental data used to create regression models of appliances energy use in a low energy building.
Content
The data set is at 10 min for about 4.5 months. The house temperature and humidity conditions were monitored with a ZigBee wireless sensor network. Each wireless node transmitted the temperature and humidity conditions around 3.3 min. Then, the wireless data was averaged for 10 minutes periods. The energy data was logged every 10 minutes with m-bus energy meters. Weather from the nearest airport weather station (Chievres Airport, Belgium) was downloaded from a public data set from Reliable Prognosis (rp5.ru), and merged together with the experimental data sets using the date and time column. Two random variables have been included in the data set for testing the regression models and to filter out non predictive attributes (parameters).

Abstract
In recent years, handwritten digits recognition has been an important area due to its applications in several fields. This work is focusing on the recognition part of handwritten Arabic digits recognition that face several challenges, including the unlimited variation in human handwriting and the large public databases. The paper provided a deep learning technique that can be effectively apply to recognizing Arabic handwritten digits. LeNet-5, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained and tested MADBase database (Arabic handwritten digits images) that contain 60000 training and 10000 testing images. A comparison is held amongst the results, and it is shown by the end that the use of CNN was leaded to significant improvements across different machine-learning classification algorithms.
The Convolutional Neural Network was trained and tested MADBase database (Arabic handwritten digits images) that contain 60000 training and 10000 testing images. Moreover, the CNN is giving an average recognition accuracy of 99.15%.
Context
The motivation of this study is to use cross knowledge learned from multiple works to enhancement the performance of Arabic handwritten digits recognition. In recent years, Arabic handwritten digits recognition with different handwriting styles as well, making it important to find and work on a new and advanced solution for handwriting recognition. A deep learning systems needs a huge number of data (images) to be able to make a good decisions.
Content
The MADBase is modified Arabic handwritten digits database contains 60,000 training images, and 10,000 test images. MADBase were written by 700 writers. Each writer wrote each digit (from 0 -9) ten times. To ensure including different writing styles, the database was gathered from different institutions: Colleges of Engineering and Law, School of Medicine, the Open University (whose students span a wide range of ages), a high school, and a governmental institution. MADBase is available for free and can be downloaded from (http://datacenter.aucegypt.edu/shazeem/) .

Short Message Service (SMS) messages are short messages sent from one person to another from their mobile phones. They represent a means of personal communication that is an important communicative artifact in our current digital era. This dataset contains SMS messages that were collected from users who knew they were participating in a research project and that their messages would be shared publicly. This dataset contains two SMS messages in two languages: Singapore English and Mandarin Chinese.
Content:
This is a corpus of SMS (Short Message Service) messages collected for research at the Department of Computer Science at the National University of Singapore. This dataset consists of 67,093 SMS messages taken from the corpus on Mar 9, 2015. The messages largely originate from Singaporeans and mostly from students attending the University. These messages were collected from volunteers who were made aware that their contributions were going to be made publicly available. The data collectors opportunistically collected as much metadata about the messages and their senders as possible, so as to enable different types of analyses.

This dataset contains a lot of short, informal texts and is ideal for trying your hand at various natural language processing tasks. There‚Äôs also a lot of information about the messages which might reveal interesting insights. Here are some ideas to get you started:
This dataset contains Singapore English. How well do tools trained on other varieties of English, like stemmers or part of speech taggers, work on it?
What time of day are most SMS messages sent? Is this different for the English and Mandarin datasets?
Unlike English, Mandarin does not have spaces between words, which can be made up of several characters. Can you build or implement a system for word identification?"

The same text can hold different meanings when expressed with different emotions. Thus understanding the text alone is not enough for getting the meaning of an utterance. Acted and natural corpora have been used to detect emotions from speech. Many speech databases for different languages including English, German, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Italian, Swedish and Spanish exist for modeling emotion recognition. Since there is no reported reference of an available Arabic corpus, we decided to collect the first Arabic Natural Audio Dataset (ANAD) to recognize discrete emotions.
Embedding an effective emotion detection feature in speech recognition system seems a promising solution for decreasing the obstacles faced by the deaf when communicating with the outside world. There exist several applications that allow the deaf to make and receive phone calls normally, as the hearing-impaired individual can type a message and the person on the other side hears the words spoken, and as they speak, the words are received as text by the deaf individual. However, missing the emotion part still makes these systems not hundred percent reliable. Having an effective speech to text and text to speech system installed in their everyday life starting from a very young age will hopefully replace the human ear. Such systems will aid deaf people to enroll in normal schools at very young age and will help them to adapt better in classrooms and with their classmates. It will help them experience a normal childhood and hence grow up to be able to integrate within the society without external help.
Eight videos of live calls between an anchor and a human outside the studio were downloaded from online Arabic talk shows. Each video was then divided into turns: callers and receivers. To label each video, 18 listeners were asked to listen to each video and select whether they perceive a happy, angry or surprised emotion. Silence, laughs and noisy chunks were removed. Every chunk was then automatically divided into 1 sec speech units forming our final corpus composed of 1384 records.
Twenty five acoustic features, also known as low-level descriptors, were extracted. These features are: intensity, zero crossing rates, MFCC 1-12 (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients), F0 (Fundamental frequency) and F0 envelope, probability of voicing and, LSP frequency 0-7. On every feature nineteen statistical functions were applied. The functions are: maximum, minimum, range, absolute position of maximum, absolute position of minimum, arithmetic of mean, Linear Regression1, Linear Regression2, Linear RegressionA, Linear RegressionQ, standard Deviation, kurtosis, skewness, quartiles 1, 2, 3 and, inter-quartile ranges 1-2, 2-3, 1-3. The delta coefficient for every LLD is also computed as an estimate of the first derivative hence leading to a total of 950 features.
I would have never reached that far without the help of my supervisors. I warmly thank and appreciate Dr. Rached Zantout, Dr. Lama Hamandi, and Dr. Ziad Osman for their guidance, support and constant supervision."

In Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) contests, contestants construct a virtual lineup of players that score points based on their real-world performances. Unlike in season-long Fantasy Sports contests,in DFS contestants submit a new lineup for each set of games. DFS contests are held for several professional sports leagues, including the National Football League (NFL), National Basketball League (NBA), and National Hockey League (NHL). The leading DFS sites today are DraftKings and Fanduel, which control approximately 90% of the $3B DFS market.
There are three primary types of DFS games: Head-to-Heads (H2Hs), Double-Ups, and Guaranteed Prize Pools (GPPs). In H2H games, two contestants play for a single cash prize. In Double-Up games, a pool of contestants compete to place in the top 50% of lineups, which are awarded twice the entry fee. In GPPs, a pool of contestants compete for a fixed prize structure that tends to be very top heavy; some contests payout hundreds of thousands of dollars to the top finisher.
Over the last year, I have developed a winning system for daily fantasy football and baseball contests. Building this system from scratch was a fantastic compliment to the things I learned as a student, from machine learning and optimization to optimal learning and game theory. I hope others can join me in researching daily fantasy basketball and perhaps get involved with the burgeoning world of daily fantasy sports.

Carbon Monoxide Daily Summary,A summary of daily CO levels from 1990 to 2017,US Environmental Protection Agency,16,"Version 1,2017-06-30",environment,CSV,2 GB,CC0,"2,549 views",314 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/epa/carbon-monoxide,"Context:
Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas that can be harmful when inhaled in large amounts. CO is released when something is burned. The greatest sources of CO to outdoor air are cars, trucks and other vehicles or machinery that burn fossil fuels. A variety of items in your home such as unvented kerosene and gas space heaters, leaking chimneys and furnaces, and gas stoves also release CO and can affect air quality indoors.
Content:
The daily summary file contains data for every monitor (sampled parameter) in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) database for each day. This file will contain a daily summary record that is:
The aggregate of all sub-daily measurements taken at the monitor.
The single sample value if the monitor takes a single, daily sample (e.g., there is only one sample with a 24-hour duration). In this case, the mean and max daily sample will have the same value.
Within the data file you will find these fields: 1. State Code: The Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code of the state in which the monitor resides.
County Code: The FIPS code of the county in which the monitor resides.
Site Num: A unique number within the county identifying the site.
Parameter Code: The AQS code corresponding to the parameter measured by the monitor.
POC: This is the ‚ÄúParameter Occurrence Code‚Äù used to distinguish different instruments that measure the same parameter at the same site.
Latitude: The monitoring site‚Äôs angular distance north of the equator measured in decimal degrees.
Longitude: The monitoring site‚Äôs angular distance east of the prime meridian measured in decimal degrees.
Datum: The Datum associated with the Latitude and Longitude measures.
Parameter Name: The name or description assigned in AQS to the parameter measured by the monitor. Parameters may be pollutants or non-pollutants.
Sample Duration: The length of time that air passes through the monitoring device before it is analyzed (measured). So, it represents an averaging period in the atmosphere (for example, a 24-hour sample duration draws ambient air over a collection filter for 24 straight hours). For continuous monitors, it can represent an averaging time of many samples (for example, a 1-hour value may be the average of four one-minute samples collected during each quarter of the hour).
Pollutant Standard: A description of the ambient air quality standard rules used to aggregate statistics. (See description at beginning of document.)
Date Local: The calendar date for the summary. All daily summaries are for the local standard day (midnight to midnight) at the monitor.
Units of Measure: The unit of measure for the parameter. QAD always returns data in the standard units for the parameter. Submitters are allowed to report data in any unit and EPA converts to a standard unit so that we may use the data in calculations.
Event Type: Indicates whether data measured during exceptional events are included in the summary. A wildfire is an example of an exceptional event; it is something that affects air quality, but the local agency has no control over. No Events means no events occurred. Events Included means events occurred and the data from them is included in the summary. Events Excluded means that events occurred but data form them is excluded from the summary. Concurred Events Excluded means that events occurred but only EPA concurred exclusions are removed from the summary. If an event occurred for the parameter in question, the data will have multiple records for each monitor.
Observation Count: The number of observations (samples) taken during the day.
Observation Percent: The percent representing the number of observations taken with respect to the number scheduled to be taken during the day. This is only calculated for monitors where measurements are required (e.g., only certain parameters).
Arithmetic Mean: The average (arithmetic mean) value for the day.
1st Max Value: The highest value for the day.
1st Max Hour: The hour (on a 24-hour clock) when the highest value for the day (the previous field) was taken.
AQI: The Air Quality Index for the day for the pollutant, if applicable.
Method Code: An internal system code indicating the method (processes, equipment, and protocols) used in gathering and measuring the sample. The method name is in the next column.
Method Name: A short description of the processes, equipment, and protocols used in gathering and measuring the sample.
Local Site Name: The name of the site (if any) given by the State, local, or tribal air pollution control agency that operates it.
Address: The approximate street address of the monitoring site.
State Name: The name of the state where the monitoring site is located.
County Name: The name of the county where the monitoring site is located.
City Name: The name of the city where the monitoring site is located. This represents the legal incorporated boundaries of cities and not urban areas.
CBSA Name: The name of the core bases statistical area (metropolitan area) where the monitoring site is located.
Date of Last Change: The date the last time any numeric values in this record were updated in the AQS data system.

Breathing air with a high concentration of CO reduces the amount of oxygen that can be transported in the bloodstream to critical organs like the heart and brain. At very high levels, which are possible indoors or in other enclosed environments, CO can cause dizziness, confusion, unconsciousness and death. Very high levels of CO are not likely to occur outdoors. However, when CO levels are elevated outdoors, they can be of particular concern for people with some types of heart disease. These people already have a reduced ability for getting oxygenated blood to their hearts in situations where the heart needs more oxygen than usual. They are especially vulnerable to the effects of CO when exercising or under increased stress. In these situations, short-term exposure to elevated CO may result in reduced oxygen to the heart accompanied by chest pain also known as angina."

The Federal Reserve sets interest rates to promote conditions that achieve the mandate set by the Congress ‚Äî high employment, low and stable inflation, sustainable economic growth, and moderate long-term interest rates. Interest rates set by the Fed directly influence the cost of borrowing money. Lower interest rates encourage more people to obtain a mortgage for a new home or to borrow money for an automobile or for home improvement. Lower rates encourage businesses to borrow funds to invest in expansion such as purchasing new equipment, updating plants, or hiring more workers. Higher interest rates restrain such borrowing by consumers and businesses.
Content
This dataset includes data on the economic conditions in the United States on a monthly basis since 1954. The federal funds rate is the interest rate at which depository institutions trade federal funds (balances held at Federal Reserve Banks) with each other overnight. The rate that the borrowing institution pays to the lending institution is determined between the two banks; the weighted average rate for all of these types of negotiations is called the effective federal funds rate. The effective federal funds rate is determined by the market but is influenced by the Federal Reserve through open market operations to reach the federal funds rate target. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets eight times a year to determine the federal funds target rate; the target rate transitioned to a target range with an upper and lower limit in December 2008. The real gross domestic product is calculated as the seasonally adjusted quarterly rate of change in the gross domestic product based on chained 2009 dollars. The unemployment rate represents the number of unemployed as a seasonally adjusted percentage of the labor force. The inflation rate reflects the monthly change in the Consumer Price Index of products excluding food and energy.
Acknowledgements
The interest rate data was published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis' economic data portal. The gross domestic product data was provided by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis; the unemployment and consumer price index data was provided by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.

People have been making music for tens of thousands of years [1]. Today, making music is easier and more accessible than ever before. The technological developments of the last few decades allow people to simulate playing every imaginable instrument on their computers. Audio sequencers enable users to arrange their songs on a time line, sample by sample. Digital audio workstations (DAWs) ship with virtual instruments and synthesizers which allow users to virtually play a whole band or orchestra in their bedrooms.
One challenge in working with DAWs is organizing samples and recordings in a structured way; so, users can easily access them. In addition to their own recordings, many users download samples. Browsing through sample collections to find the perfect sound is time consuming and may impede the user's creative flow [2]. On top of this, manually naming and tagging recordings is a time-consuming and tedious task, so not many users do [3]. The consequence is that finding the right sound at the right moment becomes a challenging problem [4].
Modeling the relationship between the acoustic content and semantic descriptions of sounds could allow users to retrieve sounds using text queries. This dataset was collected to support research on content-based audio retrieval systems, focused on sounds used in creative context.
Content
This dataset was collected from Freesound [5] in June 2016. It contains the frame-based MFCCs of about 230,000 sounds and the associated tags.
sounds.json: Sound metadata originally downloaded from the Freesound API. This file includes the id, associated tags, links to previews, and links to an analysis_frames file, which contains frame-based low-level features, for each sound.
preprocessed_tags.csv: Preprocessed tags. Contains only tags which are associated to at least 0.01% of sounds. Moreover, tags were split on hyphens and stemmed. Tags containing numbers and short tags with less than three characters were removed.
queries.csv: An aggregated query-log of real user-queries against the Freesound database, collected between May 11 and November 24 in 2016.
preprocessed_queries.csv Queries were preprocessed in the same way tags were preprocessed.
*_mfccs.csv.bz2: The original MFCCs for each sound, extracted from the URL provided in the analysis_frames field of sounds.json, split across ten files.
cb_{512|1024|2048|4096}_sparse.pkl: Codebook representation of sounds saved as sparse pd.DataFrame. The first-order and second-order derivatives of the 13 MFCCs were appended to the MFCC feature vectors of each sound. All frames were clustered using K-Means (Mini-Batch K-Means) to find {512|1024|2048|4096} cluster centers. Each frame was, then, assigned to its closest cluster center and the counts used to represent a sound as a single {512|1024|2048|4096}-dimensional vector.

I've uploaded a dataset previously that contains Paradise Papers, Panama Papers, Bahamas and Offshore Leaks. I've been getting a lot of requests to upload Paradise papers alone to make it less confusing for my fellow data scientists. Here it is, the complete cache of Paradise Papers released so far. I will keep updating it.
The Paradise Papers is a cache of some 13GB of data that contains 13.4 million confidential records of offshore investment by 120,000 people and companies in 19 tax jurisdictions (Tax Heavens - an awesome video to understand this); that was published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) on November 5, 2017. Subsequent data was released on November 20, 2017. Here is a brief video about the leak. The people include Queen Elizabeth II, the President of Columbia (Juan Manuel Santos), Former Prime Minister of Pakistan (Shaukat Aziz), U.S Secretary of Commerce (Wilbur Ross) and many more. According to an estimate by the Boston Consulting Group, the amount of money involved is around $10 trillion. The leak contains many famous companies, including Facebook, Apple, Uber, Nike, Walmart, Allianz, Siemens, McDonald‚Äôs and Yahoo.
It also contains a lot of U. S President Donald Trump allies including Rax Tillerson, Wilbur Ross, Koch Brothers, Paul Singer, Sheldon Adelson, Stephen Schwarzman, Thomas Barrack and Steve Wynn etc. The complete list of Politicians involve is available here.
I am calling all data scientists to help me stop the corruption and reveal the patterns and linkages invisible for the untrained eye.

The GSS contains a standard core of demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal questions, plus topics of special interest. Among the topics covered are civil liberties, crime and violence, intergroup tolerance, morality, national spending priorities, psychological well-being, social mobility, and stress and traumatic events.
Altogether the GSS is the single best source for sociological and attitudinal trend data covering the United States. It allows researchers to examine the structure and functioning of society in general as well as the role played by relevant subgroups and to compare the United States to other nations. (Source)

This dataset contains information obtained from an impact sensor within a Taekwondo chest protector. Participants were asked to perform various Taekwondo techniques on this chest protector for analysis of sensor readings.
Content:
Data was obtained from 6 participants performing 4 different Taekwondo techniques ‚Äì Roundhouse/Round Kick, Back Kick, Cut Kick & Punch. Participant details are summarized in Table 1. The table is organized in ascending order according to participant weight/experience level.
In the file 'Taekwondo_Technique_Classification_Stats.csv‚Äô, the data is organized as follows. The rows display:
Technique ‚Äì Roundhouse/Round Kick (R), Back Kick (B), Cut Kick (C), Punch (P)
Participant ID ‚Äì P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6
Trial # ‚Äì For each Technique, each participant performed a total of 5 trials
Sensor Readings ‚Äì Data shows the ADC readings obtained from a 12-bit ADC connected to the sensor (not listed as Voltage but can be converted to it)
The columns identify type of technique, participant, trial # and showcase the sensor readings. There are a total of 115 columns of sensor readings. Each participant performed 5 trials for each type of technique with hard intensity. The only exception is that Participant 6 (P6) did not perform Back Kicks.
Acknowledgements:
The dataset was collected at a local Taekwondo school. We would like to thank the instructor and students for taking their time to participate in our data collection!
Past Research:
Previous work to classify Taekwondo techniques included using a butter-worth low pass filter on Matlab and performing integration around the maximum signal peak. The goal was to observe a pattern in the resulting integration values to determine impact intensity for each type of technique.
Inspiration:
Main analysis questions:
1) Determine impact intensity that is proportional to the participant‚Äôs weight/experience level
Ideally, impact intensity should increase with the increasing participant weight/experience level or ID (Participant ID in Table 1 corresponds to ascending weight/experience level)
2) Classify or distinguish between types of impact (Round Kick, Back Kick, Cut Kick or Punch)
Each Taekwondo technique usually has a unique waveform to be identified"

I'm going straight to the point: I'm obsessed with Steven Wilson. I can't help it, I love his music. And I need more music with similar (almost identical) style. So, what I'm trying to solve here is, how to find songs that match SW's style with almost zero error?
I'm aware that Spotify gives you recommendations, like similar artists and such. But that's not enough -- Spotify always gives you varied music. Progressive rock is a very broad genre, and I just want those songs that sound very, very similar to Steven Wilson or Porcupine Tree.
BTW, Porcupine Tree was Steven Wilson's band, and they both sound practically the same. I made an analysis where I checked their musical similarities.
Content
I'm using the Spotify web API to get the data. They have an amazingly rich amount of information, especially the audio features.
This repository has 5 datasets:
StevenWilson.csv: contains Steven Wilson discography (65 songs)
PorcupineTree.csv: 65 Porcupine Tree songs
Complete Steven Wilson.csv: a merge between the past two datasets (Steven Wilson + Porcupine Tree)
Train.csv: 200 songs used to train KNN. 100 are Steven Wilson songs and the rest are totally different songs
Test.csv: 100 songs that may or may not be like Steven Wilson's. I picked this songs from various prog rock playlists and my Discover Weekly from Spotify.
Also, so far I've made two kernels:
Comparing Steven Wilson and Porcupine Tree
Finding songs that match SW's style using K-Nearest Neighbors
Data
There are 21 columns in the datasets.
Numerical: this columns were scraped using get_audio_features from the Spotify API.
acousticness: a confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic; 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic
danceability: it describes how suitable a track is for dancing; a value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable
duration_ms: the duration of the track in milliseconds
energy: a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity
instrumentalness: predicts whether a track contains no vocals; values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0
liveness: detects the presence of an audience in the recording; 1.0 represents high confidence that the track was performed live
loudness: the overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB)
speechiness: detects the presence of spoken words in a track; the more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value
tempo: the overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM)
valence: a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness; tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry)
Categorical: these features are categories represented as numbers.
key: the musical key the track is in. e.g. 0 = C, 1 = C‚ôØ/D‚ô≠, 2 = D, and so on
mode: mode indicates the modality (major or minor); major is represented by 1 and minor is 0
time_signature: an estimated overall time signature of a track; it is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure). e.g. 4/4, 4/3, 3/4, 8/4 etc.
Strings: these fields are mostly useless (except for name, album, artist and lyrics)
id: the Spotify ID of the song
name: name of the song
album: album of the song
artist: artist of the song
uri: the Spotify URI of the song
type: the type of the Spotify object
track_href: the Spotify API link of the song
analysis_url: the URL used for getting the audio features
lyrics: lyrics of the song in lower case
Future
Ever been obsessed with a song? an album? an artist? I'm planning on building a web app that solves this. It will help you find music extremely similar to other."

Who's the biggest downgrader? Is it better to be short, tall, or average height? How many years does it take the average climber to send her first 5.12? After countless crag debates over these and similar topics, I set out to find the answers. Now you can prove statistically why that dude who tagged your multi-year project ""Soft"" is wrong. (Sorry, he might actually be right.)

I used Python3 to build a web-scraper to collect all of the user and ascent information from the world's largest rock climbing logbook, https://www.8a.nu/. I actually ended up scraping their beta site, https://beta.8a.nu/, as it provided well-formed JSON objects. The scraper dumps all of the data into an SQLite database. Check out https://github.com/dcohen21/8a.nu-Scraper for more information about the project. This dataset was collected on 9/13/2017.

The Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program has been the starting place for law enforcement executives, students of criminal justice, researchers, members of the media, and the public at large seeking information on crime in the nation. The program was conceived in 1929 by the International Association of Chiefs of Police to meet the need for reliable uniform crime statistics for the nation. In 1930, the FBI was tasked with collecting, publishing, and archiving those statistics.
Today, four annual publications, Crime in the United States, National Incident-Based Reporting System, Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted, and Hate Crime Statistics are produced from data received from over 18,000 city, university/college, county, state, tribal, and federal law enforcement agencies voluntarily participating in the program. The crime data are submitted either through a state UCR Program or directly to the FBI‚Äôs UCR Program.
This dataset focuses on the crime rates and law enforcement employment data in the state of California.
Content
Crime and law enforcement employment rates are separated into individual files, focusing on offenses by enforcement agency, college/university campus, county, and city. Categories of crimes reported include violent crime, murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, property crime, burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle damage, and arson. In the case of rape, data is collected for both revised and legacy definitions. In some cases, a small number of enforcement agencies switched definition collection sometime within the same year.
Acknowledgements
This dataset originates from the FBI UCR project, and the complete dataset for all 2015 crime reports can be found here.
Inspiration
What are the most common types of crimes in California? Are there certain crimes that are more common in a particular place category, such as a college/university campus, compared to the rest of the state?
How does the number of law enforcement officers compare to the crime rates of a particular area? Is the ratio similar throughout the state, or do certain campuses, counties, or cities have a differing rate?
How does the legacy vs. refined definition of rape differ, and how do the rape counts compare? If you pulled the same data from FBI datasets for previous years, can you see a difference in rape rates over time?"

The NFL, ESPN, and many others have their own Quarterback rating system. Can you create your own? How many points does a QB contribute to a given game? And, with MVP trophy season coming up, who really stands out as an MVP and who is carried by their team?
QB Stats
This is scraped from footballdb.com using Pandas' read_html function. This dataset contains every regular season NFL game and every NFL passer (including non-quarterbacks) from 1996 to 2016. Individual years are available for the past 10 years, and all 21 years are in QBStats_all. In addition to the traditional stats, the total points from the game have been appended to the stats. Win/Loss is up and coming, but is not a priority at the moment since a QB cannot control how well the defense stops the opposing offense.
Content
Inside you'll find:
Quarterback Name (qb)
Attempts (att)
Completions (cmp)
Yards (yds)
Yards per Attempt (ypa)
Touchdowns (td)
Interceptions (int)
Longest Throw (lg)
Sacks (sack)
Loss of Yards (loss)
The NFL's Quarterback Rating for the game (rate)
Total points scored in the game (game_points)
Home or Away Game (home_away)
Year (year)
Important Note:
Because of the way that these were scraped, the the game week is not supplied. However, the games are all in oldest to most recent which would allow for some time-series analysis.
Additionally:
Feel free to make any requests for additional information. But due to the time that it takes to scrape 21 years of NFL stats, it will likely take a while before I finish updating the dataset.

Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI, originally High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager or HESSI) is a NASA solar flare observatory. It is the sixth mission in the Small Explorer program, selected in October 1997 and launched on 5 February 2002. Its primary mission is to explore the physics of particle acceleration and energy release in solar flares. HESSI was renamed to RHESSI on 29 March 2002 in honor of Reuven Ramaty, a pioneer in the area of high energy solar physics. RHESSI is the first space mission named after a NASA scientist. RHESSI was built by Spectrum Astro for Goddard Space Flight Center and is operated by the Space Sciences Laboratory in Berkeley, California. The principal investigator from 2002 to 2012 was Robert Lin, who was succeeded by S√§m Krucker.

Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI)
Notes: Note that only events with non-zero position and energy range not equal to 3-6 keV are confirmed as solar sources. Events which have no position and show up mostly in the front detectors, but were not able to be imaged are flagged as ""PS"".
Events which do not have valid position are only confirmed to be non-solar if the NS flag is set.
Peak Rate: peak counts/second in energy range 6-12 keV, averaged over active collimators, including background.
Total Counts: counts in energy range 6-12 keV integrated over duration of flare summed over all subcollimators, including background.
Energy: the highest energy band in which the flare was observed. Electron Kev (kilo electron volt) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronvolt
Radial Distance: distance from Sun center
Quality Codes: Qn, where n is the total number of data gap, SAA, particle, eclipse or decimation flags set for event. n ranges from 0 to 11. Use care when analyzing the data when the quality is not zero.
Active_Region: A number for the closest active region, if available
radial_offset: the offset of the flare position from the spin axis of the spacecraft in arcsec. This is used i spectroscopy.
peak_c/s: peak count rate in corrected counts.
Flare Flag Codes: a0 - In attenuator state 0 (None) sometime during flare a1 - In attenuator state 1 (Thin) sometime during flare a2 - In attenuator state 2 (Thick) sometime during flare a3 - In attenuator state 3 (Both) sometime during flare An - Attenuator state (0=None, 1=Thin, 2=Thick, 3=Both) at peak of flare DF - Front segment counts were decimated sometime during flare DR - Rear segment counts were decimated sometime during flare ED - Spacecraft eclipse (night) sometime during flare EE - Flare ended in spacecraft eclipse (night) ES - Flare started in spacecraft eclipse (night) FE - Flare ongoing at end of file FR - In Fast Rate Mode FS - Flare ongoing at start of file GD - Data gap during flare GE - Flare ended in data gap GS - Flare started in data gap MR - Spacecraft in high-latitude zone during flare NS - Non-solar event PE - Particle event: Particles are present PS - Possible Solar Flare; in front detectors, but no position Pn - Position Quality: P0 = Position is NOT valid, P1 = Position is valid Qn - Data Quality: Q0 = Highest Quality, Q11 = Lowest Quality SD - Spacecraft was in SAA sometime during flare SE - Flare ended when spacecraft was in SAA SS - Flare started when spacecraft was in SAA

What is a solar flare?
A Solar flare is the rapid release of a large amount of energy stored in the solar atmosphere. During a flare, gas is heated to 10 to 20 million degrees Kelvin (K) and radiates soft X rays and longer-wavelength emission. Unable to penetrate the Earth's atmosphere, the X rays can only be detected from space. Instruments on Skylab, SMM, the Japanese/US Yohkoh mission and other spacecraft have recorded many flares in X rays over the last twenty years or so. Ground-based observatories have recorded the visible and radio outputs. These data form the basis of our current understanding of a solar flare. But there are many possible mechanisms for heating the gas, and observations to date have not been able to differentiate between them.
HESSI's new approach
Researchers believe that much of the energy released during a flare is used to accelerate, to very high energies, electrons (emitting primarily X-rays) and protons and other ions (emitting primarily gamma rays). The new approach of the HESSI mission is to combine, for the first time, high-resolution imaging in hard X-rays and gamma rays with high-resolution spectroscopy, so that a detailed energy spectrum can be obtained at each point of the image.
This new approach will enable researchers to find out where these particles are accelerated and to what energies. Such information will advance understanding of the fundamental high-energy processes at the core of the solar flare problem. https://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/hessi/objectives.htm

Eye Gaze,Simulated and Real datasets of eyes looking in different directions,4Quant,15,"Version 2,2017-05-02|Version 1,2017-05-02",psychometrics,Other,668 MB,CC4,"7,331 views",700 downloads,21 kernels,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/4quant/eye-gaze,"Context
The main reason for making this dataset is the publication of the paper: Learning from Simulated and Unsupervised Images through Adversarial Training and the idea of the SimGAN. The dataset and kernels should make it easier to get started making SimGAN networks and testing them out and comparing them to other approaches like KNN, GAN, InfoGAN and the like.
Source
The synthetic images were generated with the windows version of UnityEyes http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/rainbow/projects/unityeyes/tutorial.html
The real images were taken from https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-multimodal-computing/research/gaze-based-human-computer-interaction/appearance-based-gaze-estimation-in-the-wild-mpiigaze/, which can be cited like this: Appearance-based Gaze Estimation in the Wild, X. Zhang, Y. Sugano, M. Fritz and A. Bulling, Proc. of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), June, p.4511-4520, (2015).
Challenges
Enhancement
One of the challenges (as covered in the paper) is enhancing the simulated images by using the real images. One possible approach is using the SimGAN which is implemented for reference in one of the notebooks. There are a number of other approaches (pix2pix, CycleGAN) which could have interesting results.
Gaze Detection
The synthetic dataset has the gaze information since it was generated by UnityEyes with a predefined look-vector. The overview notebook covers what this vector means and how each component can be interpreted. It would be very useful to have a simple, quick network for automatically generating this look vector from an image"

The election of Donald Trump has taken the world by surprise and is fuelling populist movements in Europe, e.g. in Italy, Austria and France. Understanding populism and assessing the impact of the ‚ÄúTrump effect‚Äù on Europe is a tremendous challenge, and Dalia wants to help pool brainpower to find answers.
The goal is to find out where the next wave of populism could hit in Europe by comparing and contrasting US and EU voter profiles, opinions of Trump vs Clinton voters, Brexit vs. Bremain voters, and future expectations.
Content
Expanding Dalia‚Äôs quarterly ""EuroPulse"" omnibus survey to the USA, Dalia has conducted a representative survey with n=11.283 respondents across all 28 EU member countries and n=1.052 respondents from the United States of America. To find out where the next wave of populism could hit Europe, Dalia‚Äôs survey traces commonalities in social and political mindsets (like authoritarianism, prejudice, open-mindedness, xenophobia, etc.), voting behaviour and socio-demographic profiles on both sides of the Atlantic.
Inspiration
The sources of our inspirations are many, but to name a few who influenced the way we asked questions: we were very inspired by the 'angry voter' profile laid out by Douglas Rivers, the influence of political and moral attitudes pointed out by Jonathan Haidt and the profile of ""America's forgotten working class"" by J. D. Vance.

This dataset includes annual county-level pesticide use estimates for 423 pesticides (active ingredients) applied to agricultural crops grown in the contiguous United States. Two different methods were used to estimate a range of pesticide use for all states except California. Both low and high estimate methods incorporated proprietary surveyed rates for United States Department of Agriculture Crop Reporting Districts, but the estimates differed in how they treated situations when a district was surveyed and pesticide use was not reported. Low estimates assumed zero use in the district for that pesticide; however, high estimates treated the unreported use of pesticides as missing data and estimated the pesticide usage from neighboring locations within the same region.

My family has always been serious about fantasy football. I've managed my own team since elementary school. It's a fun reason to talk with each other on a weekly basis for almost half the year.
Ever since I was in 8th grade I've dreamed of building an AI that could draft players and choose lineups for me. I started off in Excel and have since worked my way up to more sophisticated machine learning. The one thing that I've been lacking is really good data, which is why I decided to scrape pro-football-reference.com for all recorded NFL player data.
From what I've been able to determine researching, this is the most complete public source of NFL player stats available online. I scraped every NFL player in their database going back to the 1940s. That's over 25,000 players who have played over 1,000,000 football games.
The scraper code can be found here. Feel free to user, alter, or contribute to the repository.
The data was scraped 12/1/17-12/4/17
I finished in last place this year in fantasy football, so hopefully this data will help me improve my performance next year. Only 8 months until draft day!
My ultimate goal is to create an AI that ranks players every week, which could be used to set lineups and draft players. I'm also interested in predicting the winners of games. If you have any ideas or would like to collaborate, please contact me!
The data is broken into two parts. There is a players table where each player has been asigned an ID and a game stats table that has one entry per game played. These tables can be linked together using the player ID.
Player Profile Fields
Player ID: The assigned ID for the player.
Name: The player's full name.
Position: The position the player played abbreviated to two characters. If the player played more than one position, the position field will be a comma-separated list of positions (i.e. ""hb,qb"").
Height: The height of the player in feet and inches. The data format is -. So 6-5 would be six feet and five inches tall.
Weight: The weight of the player in pounds.
Current Team: The three-letter code of the team the player plays for. This is null if they are not currently active.
Birth Date: The day, month, and year the player was born. This is null if unknown.
Birth Place: The city, state or city, country the player was born in. This is null if unknown.
Death Date: The day, month, and year the player died. This is null if they are still alive.
College: The name of the college they played football at. This is null if they did not play football in college.
High School: the city, state or city, country the player went to high school. This is null if the player didn't go to high school or if the school is unknown.
Draft Team: The three letter code of the team that drafted the player. This is null if the player was not drafted.
Draft Position: The draft position number the player was taken. Again, null if the player was not drafted.
Draft Round: The round of the draft the player was drafted in. Null if the player was not drafted.
Draft Position: The position the player was drafted at as a two-letter code. Null if the player was not drafted.
Draft Year: The year the player was drafted. Null if the player was not drafted.
Current Salary Cap Hit: The player's current salary hit for their current team. Null if the player is not currently active on a team.
Hall of Fame Induction Year: The year the player was inducted into the NFL Hall of Fame. Null if the player has not been inducted into the HOF yet.
Game Stats Fields
Note that if there are games missing in the season for a player (i.e. the player has logs for games 1, 2, 3, 5, 6,...), then they didn't play in game 4 because of injury, suspension, etc.
Game Info:
Player ID: The assigned ID for the player.
Year: The year the game took place.
Date: The date the game took place.
Game Number: The number of the game when all games in a season are numbered sequentially.
Age: The age of the player when the game was played. This is in the format -. So 22-344 would be 22 years and 344 days old.
Team: The three-letter code of the team the player played for.
Game Location: One of H, A, or N. H=Home, A=Away, and N=Neutral.
Opponent: The three-letter code of the team the game was played against.
Player Team Score: The score of the team the player played for.
Opponent Score: The score of the team the player played against. You can use this field and the last field to determine if the player's team won.
Passing Stats:
Passing Attempts: The number of passes thrown by the player.
Passing Completions: The number of completions thrown by the player.
Passing Yards: The number of passing yards thrown by the player.
Passing Rating: The NFL passer rating for the player in that game.

Interceptions: The number of times the player intercepted the ball.
Interception Yards: The number of yards the player gained after interceptions.
Interception Touchdowns: The number of touchdowns the player scored after interceptions.
Safeties: The number of safeties the player caused.
Futute Improvements
Format data in an SQLite database
Extract Team IDs to make relating players across teams and games easier
Resolve Game IDs to make relating players in a given game easier
Scrape college data (there are links on the website that shouldn't be too difficult to scrape)
Figure out another method of scraping some additional data that isn't available on pro-football-reference.com, such as fumbles, passes defended, etc.
Resolve blocking stats back to lineman based on the team they played for and the QB's sack stats for that game.

The overall scope of EMHIRES is to allow users to assess the impact of meteorological and climate variability on the generation of solar power in Europe and not to mime the actual evolution of wind power production in the latest decades. For this reason, the hourly wind power generation time series are released for meteorological conditions of the years 1986-2015 (30 years) without considering any changes in the wind installed capacity. Thus, the installed capacity considered is fixed as the one installed at the end of 2015. For this reason, data from EMHIRES should not be compared with actual power generation data other than referring to the reference year 2015.

The data is available at both the national level and the NUTS 2 level. The NUTS 2 system divides the EU into 276 statistical units.

linguistics",CSV,77 KB,CC0,"2,379 views",199 downloads,,,https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/when-do-children-learn-words,"Context:
When children are born they don‚Äôt know any words. By the time they‚Äôre three, most children know 200 words or more. These words aren‚Äôt randomly selected from the language they‚Äôre learning, however. A two-year-old is much more likely to know the word ‚Äúbottle‚Äù than the word ‚Äútitration‚Äù. What words do children learn first, and what qualities do those words have? This dataset was collected to explore this question.
Content:
The main dataset includes information for 732 Norwegian words. A second table also includes measures of how frequently each word is used in Norwegian, both on the internet (as observed in the Norwegian Web as Corpus dataset) and when an adult is talking to a child. The latter is commonly called ‚Äúchild directed speech‚Äù and is abbreviated as ‚ÄúCDS‚Äù.
Main data
ID_CDI_I: Word ID from the Norwegian adaptation of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories, version 1
ID_CDI_II: Word ID from the Norwegian adaptation of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories, version 2
Word_NW: The word in Norwegian
Word_CDI: The form of the word found in the Norwegian adaptation of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories
Translation: the English translation of the Norwegian word
AoA: how old a child generally is was when they this this word, in months (Estimated from the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories)
VSoA: how many other words a child generally knows when they learn this word (rounded up to the nearest 10)
Lex_cat: the specific part of speech of the word
Broad_lex: the broad part of speech of the word
Freq: a measure of how commonly this word occurs in Norwegian
CDS_Freq: a measure of how commonly this word occurs when a Norwegian adult is talking to a Norwegian child
Norwegian CDS Frequency
Word_CDI: The word from, as found in the Norwegian adaptation of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories
Translation: The English translation of the Norwegian word
Freq_NoWaC: How often this word is used on the internet
Freq_CDS: How often this word is used when talking to children (based on two Norwegian CHILDES corpora)

Word vectors, also called word embeddings, are a multi-dimensional representation of words based on which words are used in similar contexts. They can capture some elements of words‚Äô meanings. For example, documents which use a lot of words that are clustered together in a vector space representation are more likely to be on similar topics.
Word vectors are very computationally intensive to train, and the vectors themselves will vary based on the documents or corpora they are trained on. For these reasons, it is often convenient to use word vectors which have been pre-trained rather than training them from scratch for each project.
Content:
This dataset contains 1,000,653 word embeddings of dimension 300 trained on the Spanish Billion Words Corpus. These embeddings were trained using word2vec.
Parameters for Embeddings Training:
Word embeddings were trained using the following parameters:
The selected algorithm was the skip-gram model with negative-sampling.
The minimum word frequency was 5.
The amount of ‚Äúnoise words‚Äù for the negative sampling was 20.
The 273 most common words were downsampled.
The dimension of the final word embedding was 300.
The original corpus had the following amount of data:
A total of 1420665810 raw words.
A total of 46925295 sentences.
A total of 3817833 unique tokens.
After the skip-gram model was applied, filtering of words with less than 5 occurrences as well as the downsample of the 273 most common words, the following values were obtained:
A total of 771508817 raw words.
A total of 1000653 unique tokens.

Can you use these word embeddings to improve existing parsers for Spanish? This paper outlines some approaches for this.
There has been quite a bit of work recently on how word embeddings might encode implicit gender bias. For example, this paper show how embeddings can capture stereyoptyes about career fields and gender. However, this recent paper suggests that for languages with grammatical gender (like Spanish), grammatical gender is more influential than gender bias. Do these word embeddings support that claim?

This database is managed by the US Environmental Protection Agency and contains information reported annually by some industry groups as well as federal facilities. Each year, companies across a wide range of industries (including chemical, mining, paper, oil and gas industries) that produce more than 25,000 pounds or handle more than 10,000 pounds of a listed toxic chemical must report it to the TRI. The TRI threshold was initially set at 75,000 pounds annually. If the company treats, recycles, disposes, or releases more than 500 pounds of that chemical into the environment (as opposed to just handling it), then they must provide a detailed inventory of that chemical's inventory.

Most countries of the world define poverty as a lack of money. Yet poor people themselves consider their experience of poverty much more broadly. A person who is poor can suffer from multiple disadvantages at the same time ‚Äì for example they may have poor health or malnutrition, a lack of clean water or electricity, poor quality of work or little schooling. Focusing on one factor alone, such as income, is not enough to capture the true reality of poverty.
Multidimensional poverty measures can be used to create a more comprehensive picture. They reveal who is poor and how they are poor ‚Äì the range of different disadvantages they experience. As well as providing a headline measure of poverty, multidimensional measures can be broken down to reveal the poverty level in different areas of a country, and among different sub-groups of people.
Content
OPHI researchers apply the AF method and related multidimensional measures to a range of different countries and contexts. Their analyses span a number of different topics, such as changes in multidimensional poverty over time, comparisons in rural and urban poverty, and inequality among the poor. For more information on OPHI‚Äôs research, see our working paper series and research briefings.
OPHI also calculates the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index MPI, which has been published since 2010 in the United Nations Development Programme‚Äôs Human Development Report. The Global MPI is an internationally-comparable measure of acute poverty covering more than 100 developing countries. It is updated by OPHI twice a year and constructed using the AF method.
The Alkire Foster (AF) method is a way of measuring multidimensional poverty developed by OPHI‚Äôs Sabina Alkire and James Foster. Building on the Foster-Greer-Thorbecke poverty measures, it involves counting the different types of deprivation that individuals experience at the same time, such as a lack of education or employment, or poor health or living standards. These deprivation profiles are analysed to identify who is poor, and then used to construct a multidimensional index of poverty (MPI). For free online video guides on how to use the AF method, see OPHI‚Äôs online training portal.
To identify the poor, the AF method counts the overlapping or simultaneous deprivations that a person or household experiences in different indicators of poverty. The indicators may be equally weighted or take different weights. People are identified as multidimensionally poor if the weighted sum of their deprivations is greater than or equal to a poverty cut off ‚Äì such as 20%, 30% or 50% of all deprivations.
It is a flexible approach which can be tailored to a variety of situations by selecting different dimensions (e.g. education), indicators of poverty within each dimension (e.g. how many years schooling a person has) and poverty cut offs (e.g. a person with fewer than five years of education is considered deprived).
The most common way of measuring poverty is to calculate the percentage of the population who are poor, known as the headcount ratio (H). Having identified who is poor, the AF method generates a unique class of poverty measures (MŒ±) that goes beyond the simple headcount ratio. Three measures in this class are of high importance:
Adjusted headcount ratio (M0), otherwise known as the MPI: This measure reflects both the incidence of poverty (the percentage of the population who are poor) and the intensity of poverty (the percentage of deprivations suffered by each person or household on average). M0 is calculated by multiplying the incidence (H) by the intensity (A). M0 = H x A.
Find out about other ways the AF method is used in research and policy.

During my research (code available on https://github.com/natt77/UOC---TFP) several insights were found on the relation between the information posted on the gropus and the information in FEDER. Text analytics was performed together with sentiment analysis. It would be interesting to deepen the analysis, create models to predict engagement or any other action that can help improving the life quality of people with rare diseases."

The original data set contains coordinates in UTM Zone 10 (columns X and Y). I also included Latitude and Longitude, which I converted using this spreadsheet that can be found here.
There's also a Google Trends data that shows how often a search-term is entered relative to the total search-volume. From Google Trends:
""Numbers represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. Likewise a score of 0 means the term was less than 1% as popular as the peak.""

It is the longest running continuous contaminant monitoring program of its kind in the United States. Mussel Watch monitors the concentration of contaminants in bivalves (mussels and oysters) and sediments in the coastal waters of the U.S., including the Great Lakes, to monitor bivalve health and by extension the health of their local and regional environment.
Mussel Watch consults with experts to determine appropriate contaminants to monitor; these include dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). As of 2008, Mussel Watch monitors approximately 140 analytes. In addition to the effects of contaminants, Mussel Watch is able to assess the effects of natural disasters, such as the 2005 Hurricane Katrina, and environmental disasters, such as the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Data collected by Mussel Watch can also be used to monitor the effectiveness of coastal remediation. The Mussel Watch Program utilized its 20 years of monitoring data to effectively analyze the impacts of Hurricane Katrina and has affected regulatory decisions based on the data it has collected on bivalve parasites.
You can find additional details about the history of the program here.

‚ÄúRussian is an East Slavic language and an official language in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and many minor or unrecognised territories. It is an unofficial but widely spoken language in Ukraine and Latvia, and to a lesser extent, the other countries that were once constituent republics of the Soviet Union and former participants of the Eastern Bloc.‚Äù -- ‚ÄúRussian Language‚Äù on Wikipedia
Russian has around 150 million native speakers and 110 million non-native speakers. Russian in written in Cyrillic script. This dataset is a morphologically, syntactically and semantically annotated corpus of texts in Russian, fully accessible to researchers and edited by users.
Content:
This dataset is encoded in UTF-8. There are two files included in this dataset: the corpus and the dictionary. The corpus is in .json format, while the dictionary is in plain text.
Dictionary
In the dictionary, each entry is a lemma, presented with all of its tagged derivations. The tags depend on the part of speech of the lemma. Some examples are:
Nouns: part of speech, animacy, gender & number, case
Verbs: Part of speech, aspect, transitivity, gender & number, person, tense, mood
Adjectives: part of speech (ADJF), gender, number, case
A Python script to convert the tags in this corpus to this set more commonly used in English-language linguistics can be found here.

In this corpus, each word has been grammatically tagged. You can access individual tokens using the following general path:
JSON > text > paragraphs > paragraph > [paragraph number] > sentence > [sentence number] > tokens > [token number]
Each token has: * A unique id number (@id) * The text of the token (@text) * information on the lemma (under ‚Äúl‚Äù), including the id number of the lemma as found in the dictionary
You can see an example of the token portion of the .json structure below:

As part of Cards Against Humanity Saves America, this poll is funded for one year of monthly public opinion polls. Cards Against Humanity is asking the American people about their social and political views, what they think of the president, and their pee-pee habits.
To conduct their polls in a scientifically rigorous manner, they partnered with Survey Sampling International ‚Äî a professional research firm ‚Äî to contact a nationally representative sample of the American public. For the first three polls, they interrupted people‚Äôs dinners on both their cell phones and landlines, and a total of about 3,000 adults didn‚Äôt hang up immediately. They examined the data for statistically significant correlations which can be found here: https://thepulseofthenation.com/

This dataset contains 1.3 million Sarcastic comments from the Internet commentary website Reddit. The dataset was generated by scraping comments from Reddit (not by me :)) containing the \s ( sarcasm) tag. This tag is often used by Redditors to indicate that their comment is in jest and not meant to be taken seriously, and is generally a reliable indicator of sarcastic comment content.
Content
Data has balanced and imbalanced (i.e true distribution) versions. (True ratio is about 1:100). The corpus has 1.3 million sarcastic statements, along with what they responded to as well as many non-sarcastic comments from the same source.
Labelled comments are in the train-balanced-sarcasm.csv file.

This dataset was originally published by the University of Zurich Robotics and Perception Group here. A sample of the data along with accompanying descriptions is provided here for research uses.
This presents the world's first dataset recorded on-board a camera equipped Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) flying within urban streets at low altitudes (i.e., 5-15 meters above the ground). The 2 km dataset consists of time synchronized aerial high-resolution images, GPS and IMU sensor data, ground-level street view images, and ground truth data. The dataset is ideal to evaluate and benchmark appearance-based topological localization, monocular visual odometry, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and online 3D reconstruction algorithms for MAV in urban environments.
Content
The entire dataset is roughly 28 gigabyte. We also provide a sample subset less than 200 megabyte, representing the first part of the dataset. You can download the entire dataset from this page.
The dataset contains time-synchronized high-resolution images (1920 x 1080 x 24 bits), GPS, IMU, and ground level Google-Street-View images. The high-resolution aerial images were captured with a rolling shutter GoPro Hero 4 camera that records each image frame line by line, from top to bottom with a readout time of 30 millisecond. A summary of the enclosed files is given below.
The data from the on-board barometric pressure sensor BarometricPressure.csv, accelerometer RawAccel.csv, gyroscope RawGyro.csv, GPS receiver OnbordGPS.csv, and pose estimation OnboardPose.csv is logged and timesynchronized using the clock of the PX4 autopilot board. The on-board sensor data was spatially and temporally aligned with the aerial images. The first column of every file contains the timestamp when the data was recorded expressed in microseconds. In the next columns the sensor readings are stored. The second column in OnbordGPS.csv encodes the identification number (ID) of every aerial image stored in the /MAV Images/ folder. The first column in GroundTruthAGL.csv is the ID of the aerial image, followed by the ground truth camera position of the MAV and the raw GPS data. The second column in GroundTruthAGM.csv is the ID of of the aerial image, followed by the ID of the first, second and third best match ground-level street view image in the /Street View Img/ folder.
Ground Truth
Two types of ground truth data are provided in order to evaluate and benchmark different vision-based localization algorithms. Firstly, appearance-based topological localization algorithms, that match aerial images to street level ones, can be evaluated in terms of precision rate and recall rate. Secondly, metric localization algorithms, that computed the ego-motion of the MAV using monocular visual SLAM tools, can be evaluated in terms of standard deviations from the ground truth path of the vehicle.
See more details here.

Epilepsy is a group of neurological disorders characterized by epileptic seizures. Epileptic seizures are episodes that can vary from brief and nearly undetectable to long periods of vigorous shaking.
Content
The original dataset consists of 5 different folders, each with 100 files, with each file representing a single subject/person. Each file is a recording of brain activity for 23.6 seconds. The corresponding time-series is sampled into 4097 data points. Each data point is the value of the EEG recording at a different point in time.
The column y contains the category of the 178-dimensional input vector. Specifically y in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
5- eyes open, means when they were recording the EEG signal of the brain the patient had their eyes open 4- eyes closed, means when they were recording the EEG signal the patient had their eyes closed 3- Yes they identify where the region of the tumor was in the brain and recording the EEG activity from the healthy brain area 2- They recorder the EEG from the area where the tumor was located
All subjects falling in classes 2, 3, 4, and 5 are subjects who did not have epileptic seizure
1- Recording of seizure activity
The Explanatory variables X1, X2, ..., X178
Each 178-dimensional vector contained in a row, represents a randomly selected 1-second long sample picked from the single file. Recall that each file is a recording of brain activity for 23.6 seconds. The corresponding time-series is sampled into 4097 data points.

They were obtained through javascript scraping of the browser twitter timeline rather than a Tweepy python API or the twitter timeline API.
The inspiration for this twitter dataset is comparing tweets in my own twitter analysis to find who tweets like whom, e.g. does Trump or Hillary tweet more like Kim Kardashian than one another?
Thus, this goes further back in time than anything directly available from Twitter.
The data is in JSON format rather than CSV, which will be forthcoming as well.
Kim Kardashian, Adam Savage, BillNye, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Donald Trump, and Hillary Clinton have been collected up to 2016-10-14 Richard Dawkins, Commander Scott Kelly, Barack Obama, NASA, and The Onion, tweets up to 2016-10-15.
For your own pleasure, with special thanks to the Trump Twitter Archive for providing some of the code, here is the JavaScript used to scrape tweets off of a timeline and output the results to the clipboard in JSON format:
1) Construct the query with from:TWITTERHANDLE since:DATE until:DATE
2) In the browser console set up automatic scrolling with: setInterval(function(){ scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight) }, 2500)
3) Scrape the resulting timeline with: var allTweets = []; var tweetElements = document.querySelectorAll('li.stream-item');
for (var i = 0; i < tweetElements.length; i++) { try { var el = tweetElements[i]; var text = el.querySelector('.tweet-text').textContent; allTweets.push({ id: el.getAttribute('data-item-id'), date: el.querySelector('.time a').textContent, text: text, link: el.querySelector('div.tweet').getAttribute('data-permalink-path'), retweet: text.indexOf('\""@') == 0 && text.includes(':') ? true : false }); } catch(err) {} }; copy(allTweets);

There is a well-documented phenomenon of increased suicide rates among United States military veterans. One recent analysis, published in 2016, found the suicide rate amongst veterans to be around 20 per day. The widespread nature of the problem has resulted in efforts by and pressure on the United States military services to combat and address mental health issues in and after service in the country's armed forces.
In 2013 News21 published a sequence of reports on the phenomenon, aggregating and using data provided by individual states to typify the nationwide pattern. This dataset is the underlying data used in that report, as collected by the News21 team.
Content
The data consists of six files, one for each year between 2005 and 2011. Each year's worth of data includes the general population of each US state, a count of suicides, a count of state veterans, and a count of veteran suicides.

Marathon time Predictions,Predict Marathon Results from Athletes Open Data Sources,Andrea Girardi,14,"Version 2,2017-05-13|Version 1,2017-05-13",running,CSV,6 KB,CC0,"5,193 views",564 downloads,22 kernels,4 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/girardi69/marathon-time-predictions,"Context
Every Marathoner has a time goal in mind, and this is the result of all the training done in months of exercises. Long runs, Strides, Kilometers and phisical exercise, all add improvement to the result. Marathon time prediction is an art, generally guided by expert physiologists that prescribe the weekly exercises and the milestones to the marathon.
Unfortunately, Runners have a lot of distractions while preparing the marathon, work, family, illnes, and therefore each one of us arrives to the marathon with his own story. The ""simple"" approach is to look at data after the competition, the Leaderboard.
But what if we could link the Marathon result to the training history of the Athlete? Could we find that ""non orthodox"" training plans give good results?
The Athlete Training History
As a start, I'll take just two data from the Athlete History, easy to extract. Two meaningful data, the average km run during the 4 weeks before the marathon, and the average speed that the athlete has run these km.
Meaningful, because in the last month of the training I have the recap of all the previous months that brought me to the marathon.
Easy to extract, because I can go to Strava and I have a ""side-by-side"" comparison, myself and the reference athlete. I said easy, well, that's not so easy, since I have to search every athlete and write down those numbers, the exact day the marathon happened, otherwise I will put in the average the rest days after the marathon.
I've set my future work in extracting more data and build better algorithms. Thank you for helping me to understand or suggest.

Category:

km4week
This is the total number of kilometers run in the last 4 weeks before the marathon, marathon included. If, for example, the km4week is 100, the athlete has run 400 km in the four weeks before the marathon
sp4week
This is the average speed of the athlete in the last 4 training weeks. The average counts all the kilometers done, included the slow kilometers done before and after the training. A typic running session can be of 2km of slow running, then 12-14km of fast running, and finally other 2km of slow running. The average of the speed is this number, and with time this is one of the numbers that has to be refined
cross training:
If the runner is also a cyclist, or a triathlete, does it counts? Use this parameter to see if the athlete is also a cross trainer in other disciplines
Wall21: In decimal. The tricky field. To acknowledge a good performance, as a marathoner, I have to run the first half marathon with the same split of the second half. If, for example, I run the first half marathon in 1h30m, I must finish the marathon in 3h (for doing a good job). If I finish in 3h20m, I started too fast and I hit ""the wall"". My training history is, therefore, less valid, since I was not estimating my result
Marathon time:
In decimal. This is the final result. Based on my training history, I must predict my expected Marathon time
Category:
This is an ancillary field. It gives some direction, so feel free to use or discard it. It groups in:
- A results under 3h
- B results between 3h and 3h20m
- C results between 3h20m and 3h40m
- D results between 3h40 and 4h

The Goal of this Competition:
Based on my training history, I must predict my expected Marathon time. Which other relevant data could help me to be more precise? Heart rate, cadence, speed training, what else? And how could I get those data?"
Who starts and who debunks rumors,Webpages cited by rumor trackers,Armineh Nourbakhsh,14,"Version 3,2017-03-27|Version 2,2017-03-22|Version 1,2017-03-21","linguistics
sociology",CSV,9 MB,CC0,"4,070 views",344 downloads,6 kernels,,https://www.kaggle.com/arminehn/rumor-citation,"Context
Emergent.info was a major rumor tracker, created by veteran journalist Craig Silverman. It has been defunct for a while, but its well-structured format and well-documented content provides an opportunity for analyzing rumors on the web.
Snopes.com is one of the oldest rumors trackers on the web. Originally launched by Barbara and David Mikkelson, it is now run by a team of editors who investigate urban legends, myths, viral rumors and fake news. The investigators try to provide a detailed explanation for why they have chosen to confirm or debunk a rumor, often citing several web pages and other external sources.
Politifact.com is a fact-checker that is focused on statements made by politicians and claims circulated by political campaigns, blogs and similar websites. Politifact's labels range from ""true,"" to ""pants on fire!""
Content
This dataset consists of three files. One file is a collection of all webpages cited in Emergent.info, and the second is a collection of webpages cited in Snopes.com, and the third is a similar collection from Politifact.com. The webpages were often cited because they had started a rumor, shared a rumor, or debunked a rumor.
Emergent.info
Emergent.info often provides a clean timeline of the rumor's propagation on the web, and identifies which page was for the rumor, which page was against it, and which page was simply observing it. Please refer to the image below to learn more about the fields in this dataset.
Snopes.com
The structure of posts on Snopes.com is not as well-defined. Please refer to the image below to learn more about the fields in the Snopes dataset.
Politifact.com
Similar to Emergent.info, Politifact.com follows a well-structured format in reporting and documenting rumors. There is a sidebar on the right side of each page that lists all of the sources cited within the page. The top link is the likeliest to be the original source of the rumor. For this link, page_is_first_citation is set to true.
Inspiration
I created this dataset in order to study domains that frequently start, propagate, or debunk rumors. By studying these domains and people who follow them, I hope to gain some insight into the dynamics of rumor propagation on the web, as well as social media.
Notes/Disclaimer
When using the Snopes dataset, please keep the following in mind:
In addition to debunking rumors, Snopes.com occasionally reports news and other types of content. This collection only includes data from ""Fact Check"" posts on Snopes.
Snopes.com was launched years ago. Some of the older posts on the website do not follow the current format of the site, therefore some of the fields might be missing.
Snopes.com used to use a service named ""DoNotLink.com"" for citation purposes. That service is no longer active and as a result some of the links are missing from older posts on Snopes.
In addition, some of the shortened links would time-out prior to resolution, in which case they would not be added to the dataset.
Occasionally, a website that has been cited has not maliciously started a rumor. For instance, Andy Borowitz is a humorist who writes for The New Yorker. His satirical column is sometimes mistaken for real news; as a result, The New Yorker may be cited as a source of fake news on Snopes.com. This does not mean that The New Yorker is a fake news website.
When using the Politifact dataset, please keep the following in mind:
The data included in this dataset are collected from the ""truth-o-meter"" page of Politifact.com.
Politifact often fact-checks statements made by politicians. Since this dataset is focused on websites, I have ignored all the posts in which the rumor was attributed to a person, a political party, a campaign, or an organization. Instead, I have only included rumors attributed explicitly to websites or blogs.
Useful Tips for Using the Snopes collection
As opposed to the Emergent collection where each page is flagged with whether it was for or against a rumor, no such information is available for the Snopes dataset. To avoid manually labeling the data, you may use the following heuristics to identify which page started a rumor:
Webpages that are cited in the ""Examples"" section of a post are often ""observing"" the rumor, i.e. they have not started it, but they are repeating it. In the snopes.csv file, these webpages have been flagged as ""page_is_example.""
Webpages that are cited in the ""Featured Image"" section of a post are often not related to the rumor. The editors on Snopes have simply extracted an image from those pages to embed in their posts. In the snopes.csv file, these webpages have been flagged as ""page_is_image_credit.""
Webpages that are cited through a secondary service (such as archive.is) are likelier to be rumor-propagators. Editors do not link to them directly so that a record of their page is available, even if it is later deleted.
If neither of these hints help, very often (but not always) the first link cited on the page (for which ""page_is_example"" and ""page_is_image_credit"" are false) is the link to a page that started the rumor. This link is identified by the ""page_is_first_citation"" field. Pages for which both ""page_is_first_citation"" and ""page_is_archived"" are true are very likely to be rumor propagators.
To identify satirical websites that are mistaken for real news, it's useful to inspect the way they are cited on Snopes. To demonstrate that a website contains satire or humor, Snopes writers often cite the ""about us"" page of the site. Therefore it's useful to see which domains often contain a URI to their ""about"" page (e.g. ""http://politicops.com/about-us/"")."
Planes in Satellite Imagery,Detect aircraft in Planet satellite image chips,rhammell,14,"Version 9,2018-01-22|Version 8,2017-09-11|Version 7,2017-07-29|Version 6,2017-06-29|Version 5,2017-06-20|Version 4,2017-05-26|Version 3,2017-05-19|Version 2,2017-05-15|Version 1,2017-05-02",,{}JSON,79 MB,CC4,"4,520 views",281 downloads,3 kernels,2 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/rhammell/planesnet,"Context
Satellite imagery provides unique insights into various markets, including agriculture, defense and intelligence, energy, and finance. New commercial imagery providers, such as Planet and BlackSky, are using constellations of small satellites to exponentially increase the amount of images of the earth captured every day.
This flood of new imagery is outgrowing the ability for organizations to manually look at each image that gets captured, and there is a need for machine learning and computer vision algorithms to help automate the analysis process.
The aim of this dataset is to help address the difficult task of detecting the location of airplanes in satellite images. Automating this process can be applied to many issues including monitoring airports for activity and traffic patterns, and defense intelligence.
Continusouly updates will be made to this dataset as new Planet imagery released. Current images were collected as late as July 2017.
Content
Provided is a zipped directory planesnet.zip that contains the entire dataset as .png image chips. Each individual image filename follows a specific format: {label} __ {scene id} __ {longitude} _ {latitude}.png
label: Valued 1 or 0, representing the ""plane"" class and ""no-plane"" class, respectively.
scene id: The unique identifier of the PlanetScope visual scene the image chip was extracted from. The scene id can be used with the Planet API to discover and download the entire scene.
longitude_latitude: The longitude and latitude coordinates of the image center point, with values separated by a single underscore.
The dataset is also distributed as a JSON formatted text file planesnet.json. The loaded object contains data, label, scene_ids, and location lists.
The pixel value data for each 20x20 RGB image is stored as a list of 1200 integers within the data list. The first 400 entries contain the red channel values, the next 400 the green, and the final 400 the blue. The image is stored in row-major order, so that the first 20 entries of the array are the red channel values of the first row of the image.
The list values at index i in labels, scene_ids, and locations each correspond to the i-th image in the data list.
Class Labels
The ""plane"" class includes 8000 images. Images in this class are near-centered on the body of a single airplane, with the majority of the plane's wings, tail, and nose also visible. Examples of different aircraft sizes, orientations, and atmospheric collection conditions are included. Example images from this class are shown below.
The ""no-plane"" class includes 24000 images. A third of these are a random sampling of different landcover features - water, vegetion, bare earth, buildings, etc. - that do not include any portion of an airplane. The next third are ""partial planes"" that contain a portion of an airplane, but not enough to meet the full definition of the ""plane"" class. The last third are ""confusers"" - chips with bright objects or strong linear features that resemble a plane - that have previously been mislabeled by machine learning models. Example images from this class are shown below.

Open Sprayer will hopefully be an open sourced autonomous land drone that will propel itself across the fields spraying weeds it can see with its mounted cameras. The project should involve a mix of mechanical engineering, classical software design and machine learning to achieve its goal. The project is meant to be a DIY effort to compete with the big companies like John Deere currently developing similar tech. The benefit of an open design is cheaper capital and maintenance cost. The ability to fix, update and repair your own sprayer would offer a great alternative to the usual high running costs of branded machines.
The data set includes around 150 photos with annotations (Bounding box coordinates) locating the broad leaved docks. 70% were taken by me with the remaining being collected on google. I plan to update the images to better reflect the images that the sprayer drone will produce when operating. When the drone is running photos will most likely be taken from a height looking straight down at the ground, therefore the google images may be useless or not? Give me feedback and I can take more pictures to improve the dataset."

 parties may contact Retrosheet at ""www.retrosheet.org"".
Roughly speaking an event is an outcome in a baseball game. This includes the end result of a plate appearance (strikeout, out in the field, hit, base on balls), events that occur within a plate appearance (stolen bases, caught stealing), and rare other occurrences. The retrosheet event data prior to 1955 are not complete. The data subsequent to 1988 include pitch counts while the data prior do not. The data here cover the years 1970-2015, in three divisions (1970-1992, 1993-2004, 2005-2015) that correspond, roughly, to distinct eras with different run-scoring environments. These data have specifically been obtained with a mix of the data dumps available at baseball heatmaps and with the py-retrosheet Python package, available on github.
I have augmented the data provided by retrosheet with some additional fields. Most substantively the rows include the wOBA value of the event, in the field woba_pts, and an estimated time stamp, in units of seconds since Jan. 1, 1900 (time_since_1900).
The conversion from retrosheet files to sql and csv is done by the chadwick software. A detailed description of all of the fields is available on the documentation for chadwick, http://chadwick.sourceforge.net/doc/cwevent.html.

Only two major-party candidates are competing in the 2016 US presidential election, but there was tough competition to get to the general election. This dataset contains transcripts of every Democratic, Republican, and Republican Undercard debate held during the 2016 primary season.
This dataset is meant to be a complement to Megan Risdal's transcripts of the 2016 US Presidential (General Election) Debates.
So you can now take all of the questions (who talks the most? who has a wider vocabulary?) that you answered in the general election debates, and apply the same procedures to see how your favorite (or least favorite) candidate has changed over time.
The column names (and order) in this dataset are a superset of those found in the general election dataset, and non-speech annotations (such as ""(applause)"") in this dataset are also a superset. Kernels uploaded for the general election dataset should be compatible with this dataset as well; please let me know if you have any compatibility issues.
What in the world is an ""Undercard"" debate?
The field of Republicans running for President in the primaries was (yuuuuge!) pretty big: 17 candidates threw their hat in the ring at one point or another. Debate organizers realized that having 17 people on stage (each with a set amount of time to answer a question / respond to a criticism / interrupt each other) would, in the best case, lead to a three-to-four-hour-long debate (and, in the worst case, lead to a chaotic shout-fest as candidates tried to talk over each other for three to four hours).
To alleviate this issue, many of the Republican debate nights were split into two separate debates: the main debate with the top party contenders, aired live during primetime; and the Undercard debate, which typically aired a few hours earlier than the main debate.
The criteria for a candidate to be allowed into the main debate (rather than the ""kids' table"" debate, as some pundits derisively called the Undercard event) varied a bit by event. Typically a poll showing of 1% in one of several specified polls was sufficient to gain admission to the Undercard. To get into the main debate, candidates had to either (a) be polling above a different, higher, percentage in specific polls, or (b) be among the top n Republican candidates in said polls.
The details get a little thorny (certain debates had multiple criteria, of which candidates had to meet at least one), so I refer questions to the individual Undercard debate pages at the American Presidency Project for detailed criteria.
In this dataset, the split between Republican debates is made in the Party column: Republican is used for the primetime main events, and Republican Undercard is used for the Undercard.

Updates
v2 contains a few minor changes related to normalizing parenthesized elements (non-speech) within the Text field, and adding a few lines of interruptions that persisted in the Text field
The Data
The fields are described more fully in the file description. This section describes the particular elements that can appear in the Speaker and Text fields.
Who's Who?
(aka, the Speaker column)
The primary debates had a ton of participants. This dataset contains utterances from 22 politicians and 49 moderators, not to mention the occasional audience laughter or 2-minute timer.
Almost all Speaker columns contain either a single title-case name (listed below in the Participants and Moderators subsections) or a single upper-case word indicating non-speaker noise (listed below in the None-speaker Turns subsection); the exceptions to this are cases where a name is concatenated with a space and a parenthesized tag, as follows:
spkr (VIDEO): transcriptions of pre-recorded material of any of the candidates or moderators
spkr (TRANSLATED): in the Univision/Telemundo debate, some questions and answers are translated into English from the original Spanish; the transcript reflects the translations as spoken by a translator
Non-speaker Turns
The non-speaker turns in the Speaker column are:
AUDIENCE: any laughter, booing, applause, etc. from the audience
CANDIDATES: cross-talk between candidates
OTHER: non-speaker, non-audience noise (such as commercial break, timer bell, national anthem, etc.)
QUESTION: a question from an audience member (or a prerecorded question)
UNKNOWN: cases where the transcriber could hear a phrase but could not determine who said it
Here are the various speakers who appear in the dataset:

¬´ BIXI Montr√©al is a public bicycle sharing system serving Montr√©al, Quebec, Canada.
Launched in May 2009, it is North America's first large-scale bike sharing system and the original BIXI brand of systems.
The location of a BIXI bike station is determined by several parameters, including population density, points of interest and activities (universities, bike paths, other transportation networks, and data on travel patterns of the general public. In 2009, 5,000 bikes were deployed in Montreal through a network of pay stations located mainly in the boroughs of Rosemont‚ÄìLa Petite-Patrie, the Plateau-Mont-Royal and Ville-Marie, spilling over into parts of Outremont and the South West. As of 2011, the system has spread to Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Villeray‚ÄìSaint-Michel‚ÄìParc-Extension, Ahuntsic, C√¥te-des-Neiges‚ÄìNotre-Dame-de-Gr√¢ce, Westmount and Verdun. ¬ª [1]
Content
1. BIXI - Movements history
Datasets containing the details of the travels made via the BIXI Montr√©al self-service bike network. Each year is a .zip file (ex. BixiMontrealRentals2014.zip) containing several .CSV files (ex. OD_2014-04.csv) for each months.

Version 2 : All .csv are merged per year (OD-year.csv).

The data is extracted from the BIXI Montr√©al station and bike management system. Trips of less than 1 minute or more than 2 hours are excluded. The station identifiers used correspond to those of the station status data set
Data Sructure
start_date: Date and time of the start of the trip ( AAAA-MM-JJ hh:mm )
start_station_code: Start station ID
end_date: Date and time of the start of the trip ( AAAA-MM-JJ hh:mm )
end_station_code : End station ID
is_member : Type users. (1 : Suscriber, 0 : Non-suscriber)
duration_sec: Total travel time in seconds

2. BIXI - The condition of stations
This dataset presents the list of stations in the BIXI Montr√©al self-service bicycle network, including the geographic position, the number of bicycles available and the number of terminals available. It is a .json file, which corresponds to a dictionary.
The data is produced by the BIXI Montr√©al station management system with a refresh rate of 5 minutes. Station locations are generally stable over time, but may be subject to change during the season, particularly when the City of Montreal is carrying out work or as part of special events. Temporary storage stations are not included in station status. The data is automatically generated on the BIXI servers, so the date of last update of this dataset does not represent the actual date of update. Information about bikes and bad terminals is available in the JSON format file.
Data Sructure
id: Unique station ID
s: Name of the station
n: Station terminal ID
st: Station status
b: Boolean value (true or false) specifying whether the station is blocked
su: Boolean value (true or false) specifying whether the station is suspended
m: Boolean value (true or false) specifying whether the station is displayed as out of service
read: timestamp of the last update of the data in milliseconds since January 1, 1970.
lc: timestamp of the last communication with the server in milliseconds since January 1, 1970.
bk: (For future use)
bl: (For future use)

Data Scientists often use crowdsourcing platforms, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk or CrowdFlower to collect labels for their data. Controlling high quality and timeless execution of tasks is an important part of such collection process. It is not possible (or not efficient) to manually check every worker assignment. There is an intuition that there quality could be predicted based on workers task browser behaviour (e.g. key presses, scrolling, mouse clicks, tab switching). In this dataset there are assignment results for 3 different crowdsourcing tasks launched on CrowdFlower, along with associated workers behaviour.
Content
We collected data running 3 tasks:
Image labelling,
Receipt Transcription,
Business Search.
Tasks are described in tasks.csv. Results for corresponding tasks are given in files: results_{task_id}.csv. Workers's activity could be found in the following files:
activity_keyboard.csv - timestamps of keyboard keys pressed
activity_mouse.csv - timestamps of mouse clicks with associated HTML elements
activity_tab.csv - timestamps of event task browser tab changes (opened, active, hidden, closed)
activity_page.csv - a summary of events happened in the task page every 2 seconds (boolean keyboard activity, boolean mouse movement activity, boolean scrolling activity, the position of the screen, boolean if text was selected)
Result files have a similar structure to the original one given by CrowdFlower:
_unit_id: A unique ID number created by the system for each row
_created_at: The time the contributor submitted the judgement
_golden: This will be ""true"" if this is a test question, otherwise it is ""false""
_id: A unique ID number generated for this specific judgment
_missed: This will be ""true"" if the row is an incorrect judgment on a test question.
_started_at: The time at which the contributor started working on the judgement
_tainted: This will be ""true"" if the contributor has been flagged for falling below the required accuracy. This judgment will not be used in the aggregation.
_channel: The work channel that the contributor accessed the job through
_trust: The contributor's accuracy. Learn more about trust here
_worker_id: A unique ID number assigned to the contributor (in the current dataset MD5 value is given)
_country: The country the contributor is from
_region: A region code for the area the contributor is from
_city: The city the contributor is from
_ip: The IP address for the contributor (in the current dataset MD5 value is given)
{{field}}: There will be a column for each field in the job, with a header equal to the field's name.
{{field}}_gold: The correct answer for the test question

The collection includes about 45,000 menus from the 1840s to the present, and the goal of the digitization project is to transcribe each page of each menu, creating an enormous database of dishes, prices, locations, and so on. As of early November, 2016, the transcribed database contains 1,332,279 dishes from 17,545 menus.
The Data
This dataset is split into four files to minimize the amount of redundant information contained in each (and thus, the size of each file). The four data files are Menu, MenuPage, MenuItem, and Dish. These four files are described briefly here, and in detail in their individual file descriptions below.
Menu
The core element of the dataset. Each Menu has a unique identifier and associated data, including data on the venue and/or event that the menu was created for; the location that the menu was used; the currency in use on the menu; and various other fields.
Each menu is associated with some number of MenuPage values.
MenuPage
Each MenuPage refers to the Menu it comes from, via the menu_id variable (corresponding to Menu:id). Each MenuPage also has a unique identifier of its own. Associated MenuPage data includes the page number of this MenuPage, an identifier for the scanned image of the page, and the dimensions of the page.
Each MenuPage is associated with some number of MenuItem values.
MenuItem
Each MenuItem refers to both the MenuPage it is found on -- via the menu_page_id variable -- and the Dish that it represents -- via the dish_id variable. Each MenuItem also has a unique identifier of its own. Other associated data includes the price of the item and the dates when the item was created or modified in the database.
Dish
A Dish is a broad category that covers some number of MenuItems. Each dish has a unique id, to which it is referred by its affiliated MenuItems. Each dish also has a name, a description, a number of menus it appears on, and both date and price ranges.
Inspiration
What are some things we can look at with this dataset?
How has the median price of restaurant dishes changed over time? Are there particular types of dishes (alcoholic beverages, seafood, breakfast food) whose price changes have been greater than or less than the average change over time?
Can we predict anything about a dish's price based on its name or description?
-- There's been some work on how the words used in advertisements for potato chips are reflective of their price; is that also true of the words used in the name of the food?
-- Are, for example, French or Italian words more likely to predict a more expensive dish?

I am interested in indoor positioning technology and had been playing with blue-tooth beacons. Typically blue-tooth beacons have accuracy of a range between 1 to 4 meters. I am thinking of maybe using machine learning can produce results of greater accuracy compared to using traditional filtering methods e.g. kalman filters, particle filters.

‚òÖ It‚Äôs possible to surf through several cities and countries which fares are available for use. If a fare is not in the app, now it‚Äôs easier than ever to let us know thanks to Questbee Apps.
We invite users to contribute to our project and expect this data set to be useful, please don't hesitate to contact us to info@ashkadata.com to add your city or to contribute with this project.
Content
The data is collected from June 2016 until July 20th 2017. The data is not completely clean, many users forget to turn off the taximeter when done with the route. Hence, we encourage data scientist to explore it and trim the data a little bit
Acknowledgements
We have to acknowledge the valuable help of our users, who have contributed to generate this dataset and have push our growth by mouth to mouth recommendation.
Inspiration
Our first inspiration for the App was after being scammed in our home city Quito. We started it as a tool for people to be fairly charged when riding a taxi. Currently with other transportation options available, we also help user to compare fares in their cities or the cities which they are visiting.

The results of the elections are available online for each ~67000 polling stations around the country. This data can be used to gain insights about both the electorate and the candidates. Examples of basic questions worth looking at are:
How are candidates' scores correlated with each other? Can you infer 'political affinity' of the candidates just looking at the data, without any other a priori knowledge?
How are scores of various candidates correlated with the turnout? Supporters of which candidate are the most 'participative'?
How did the votes get redistributed from the first to the second round? Can you build an a posteriori predictive model of the second round results taking as an input the results of the first round ?
The data provides coordinates of each polling station. Can you gain any insight from the geography?
Some preliminary analysis is described in two blog posts here and here. This dataset is inspired by an analogous one for the 2016 US elections by Ben Hamner."

Context
This dataset contains molecular properties scraped from the PubChem database. Each file contains properties for thousands of molecules , made up of the elements H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I. The dataset is related to a previous one which had fewer number of molecules, where the features were preconstructed.
Instead, this dataset is a challenging case for feature engineering and is subject of active research (see references below).

En: This field is the molecular energy calculated using a force-field method. See references [1,2] for details. This is the target variable which is being predicted.
atoms: This field contains the name of the element and the position (x,y,z coordinates) and needs to be used for feature engineering.
id : This field is the PubChem Id
shapeM : This field contains the shape multipoles and can be used for feature engineering. For definition of shape multipoles, see reference [3].
Notice that each molecule contains different number and types of atoms, so it is challenging to come up with features that can describe every molecule in a unique way. There are several approaches taken in the literature (see the references), one of which is to use the Coulomb Matrix for a given molecule defined by
CIJ=
ZIZJ
|RI‚àíRJ|
,(I‚â†J)CIJ=Z
2.4
I
,(I=J)
where $Z_I$ are atomic numbers (can be looked up from the periodic table for each element), and ${\vert R_I - R_J \vert}$ is the distance between two atoms I and J. The previous dataset used these features for a subset of molecules given here, where the maximum number of elements in a given molecules was limited by 50. In this case, each molecule has a 50x50 Coulomb matrix where zeroes were used as padding when the molecule had smaller than 50 number of atoms.
There are around 100,000,000 molecules in the whole database. As more files are scraped, new data will be added in time.
Note: In the previous dataset, the molecular energies were computed by quantum mechanical simulations. Here, the given energies are computed using another method, so their values are different.
Inspiration
Simulations of molecular properties are computationally expensive. The purpose of this project is to use machine learning methods to come up with a model that can predict molecular properties from a database. In the PubChem database, there are around 100,000,000 molecules. It could take years to do simulations on all of these molecules, however machine learning can be used to predict their properties much faster. As a result, this could open up many possibilities in computational design and discovery of molecules, compounds and new drugs.
This is a regression problem so mean squared error is minimized during training.
I am looking for Kagglers to find the best model and reduce mean squared error as much as possible!

The death penalty was authorized by 32 states, the Federal Government, and the U.S. Military. While Connecticut, Maryland, and New Mexico no longer have death penalty statutes, they do currently incarcerate death-sentenced offenders. Texas leads the nation in the number of executions since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. California, Florida, Texas, and Pennsylvania have the largest death row populations.
The following crimes are Capital Murder in Texas:
murder of a peace officer or fireman who is acting in the lawful discharge of an official duty and who the person knows is a peace officer or fireman;
murder during the commission or attempted commission of kidnapping, burglary, robbery, aggravated sexual assault, arson, obstruction or retaliation, or terroristic threat;
murder for remuneration or promise of remuneration or employs another to commit murder for remuneration or promise of remuneration;
murder during escape or attempted escape from a penal institution;
murder, while incarcerated in a penal institution, of a correctional employee or with the intent to establish, maintain, or participate in a combination or in the profits of a combination;
murder while incarcerated in a penal institution for a conviction of murder or capital murder;
murder while incarcerated in a penal institution serving a life sentence or a 99 year sentence for a conviction of aggravated kidnapping, aggravated sexual assault, or aggravated robbery;
murder of more than one person during the same criminal transaction or during different criminal transactions but the murders are committed pursuant to the same scheme or course of conduct;
murder of an individual under ten years of age; or
murder in retaliation for or on account of the service or status of the other person as a judge or justice of the supreme court, the court of criminal appeals, a court of appeals, a district court, a criminal district court, a constitutional county court, a statutory county court, a justice court, or a municipal court.

This dataset consists of 384 features extracted from CT images. The class variable is numeric and denotes the relative location of the CT slice on the axial axis of the human body. The data was retrieved from a set of 53500 CT images from 74 different patients (43 male, 31 female).
Content
Each CT slice is described by two histograms in polar space. The first histogram describes the location of bone structures in the image, the second the location of air inclusions inside of the body. Both histograms are concatenated to form the final feature vector. Bins that are outside of the image are marked with the value -0.25.
The class variable (relative location of an image on the axial axis) was constructed by manually annotating up to 10 different distinct landmarks in each CT Volume with known location. The location of slices in between landmarks was interpolated.
Field Descriptions:
patientId: Each ID identifies a different patient
value[1-241]: Histogram describing bone structures
value[242 - 385]: Histogram describing air inclusions
386: Relative location of the image on the axial axis (class value).
Values are in the range [0; 180] where 0 denotes the top of the head and 180 the soles of the feet.

The Corruption Perceptions Index scores and ranks countries/territories based on how corrupt a country‚Äôs public sector is perceived to be. It is a composite index, a combination of surveys and assessments of corruption, collected by a variety of reputable institutions. The CPI is the most widely used indicator of corruption worldwide.
Corruption generally comprises illegal activities, which are deliberately hidden and only come to light through scandals, investigations or prosecutions. There is no meaningful way to assess absolute levels of corruption in countries or territories on the basis of hard empirical data. Possible attempts to do so, such as by comparing bribes reported, the number of prosecutions brought or studying court cases directly linked to corruption, cannot be taken as definitive indicators of corruption levels. Instead, they show how effective prosecutors, the courts or the media are in investigating and exposing corruption.

The Advanced Placement Exam scores for the class of 2016, highlighted in this dataset, show that students continue to demonstrate college-level skills and knowledge in increasing numbers. Even as AP teachers deliver rigor to an ever-diversifying population of students, participation and performance continue to improve. Behind and within these data are the daily sacrifices of AP students and teachers, including the late nights that students put in diligently studying and the weekends that teachers give up to help their students succeed. Their hard work and effort are worth celebrating.

Between 1901 and 2016, the Nobel Prizes and the Prize in Economic Sciences were awarded 579 times to 911 people and organizations. The Nobel Prize is an international award administered by the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm, Sweden, and based on the fortune of Alfred Nobel, Swedish inventor and entrepreneur. In 1968, Sveriges Riksbank established The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, founder of the Nobel Prize. Each Prize consists of a medal, a personal diploma, and a cash award.
A person or organization awarded the Nobel Prize is called Nobel Laureate. The word ""laureate"" refers to being signified by the laurel wreath. In ancient Greece, laurel wreaths were awarded to victors as a sign of honor.

This is the keystroke dataset for the study titled 'High-accuracy detection of early Parkinson's Disease using multiple characteristics of finger movement while typing'. This research report is currently under review for publication by PLOS ONE.
The dataset contains keystroke logs collected from over 200 subjects, with and without Parkinson's Disease (PD), as they typed normally on their own computer (without any supervision) over a period of weeks or months (having initially installed a custom keystroke recording app, Tappy). This dataset has been collected and analyzed in order to indicate that the routine interaction with computer keyboards can be used to detect changes in the characteristics of finger movement in the early stages of PD.
Data
The participants, from the U.S., Canada, UK and Australia, had visited the project website and agreed to participate in the study. The research was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee at Charles Sturt University, Australia, protocol number H17013.
Each data file collected includes the timing information from typing activity as the participants used their various Windows applications (such as email, word processing, web searches and the like). The keystroke acquisition software ('Tappy') provided timing accuracy of key press and release timestamps to within several milliseconds.
The data files comprise two Zip archives, one with the participant detail files and the other with the keystroke data files for each user.

Originally, images were extracted from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) dataset. The NAIP dataset consists of a total of 330,000 scenes spanning the whole of the Continental United States (CONUS). The authors used the uncompressed digital Ortho quarter quad tiles (DOQQs) which are GeoTIFF images and the area corresponds to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) topographic quadrangles. The average image tiles are ~6000 pixels in width and ~7000 pixels in height, measuring around 200 megabytes each. The entire NAIP dataset for CONUS is ~65 terabytes. The imagery is acquired at a 1-m ground sample distance (GSD) with a horizontal accuracy that lies within six meters of photo-identifiable ground control points.
The images consist of 4 bands - red, green, blue and Near Infrared (NIR). In order to maintain the high variance inherent in the entire NAIP dataset, we sample image patches from a multitude of scenes (a total of 1500 image tiles) covering different landscapes like rural areas, urban areas, densely forested, mountainous terrain, small to large water bodies, agricultural areas, etc. covering the whole state of California. An image labeling tool developed as part of this study was used to manually label uniform image patches belonging to a particular landcover class.
Once labeled, 28x28 non-overlapping sliding window blocks were extracted from the uniform image patch and saved to the dataset with the corresponding label. We chose 28x28 as the window size to maintain a significantly bigger context, and at the same time not to make it as big as to drop the relative statistical properties of the target class conditional distributions within the contextual window. Care was taken to avoid interclass overlaps within a selected and labeled image patch.

Their intended use is for computer simulations of solar energy conversion systems and building systems to facilitate performance comparisons of different system types, configurations, and locations in the United States and its territories. Because they represent typical rather than extreme conditions, they are not suited for designing systems to meet the worst-case conditions occurring at a location.
Please note that TMY3 is NOT the state of the art solar data. It was used as a key component of investment analyses for several years, but NREL has released a more recent version based on satellite data and updated meteorological models that provides coverage for the entire United States. That dataset is much too large to publish here, but is highly recommended if you need the best information.
Content
Please see the pdf manual for full details of each field; there are several dozen of them.
It's important to know that nearly all of the solar data is modeled based on estimates of cloud cover; less than 1% of the stations directly measured sunlight.
This data is not appropriate for time series analysis. A typical meteorological year is literally twelve months of real data from twelve different years. Please see the manual for further details.

Few events in American history are better known than the Salem witchcraft trials of 1692. Its popularity is doubtless attributable to a number of things: a persistent fascination with the occult; a perverse pleasure to expose the underbelly of an American culture that boasts of toleration, social harmony, and progress; and an appreciation for a compelling, dramatic narrative replete with heroes and villains. Skeptics, like the preeminent twentieth-century historian Perry Miller, question whether the Salem trials constituted anything more than an inconsequential episode in colonial history. But most historians consider Salem worthy of continuing investigation even if it was less than a major turning point in history. Indeed, Salem has been an unusually fertile field for historical research because it readily lends itself to new approaches, insights, and methodologies. To understand what happened in Salem, historians have profitably applied the perspectives of politics, anthropology, economic and social analysis, religion, social psychology, and demography. If the ultimate meaning of Salem is still elusive, these investigations have broadened and deepened our understanding of the 1692 witchcraft outbreak.
Content:
The Salem Witchcraft Website contains eight data sets. They provide only a small portion of the historical record about Salem. They do not contain transcripts of examinations or trials or contemporary narrative accounts, for example. Instead, they provide information, primarily of a quantitative nature, about three major aspects of the outbreak: its chronology, its geographic spread, and the social and economic divisions in Salem Village that shaped events. The data were derived primarily from four published sources: Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum's three-volume transcription of the legal records of the witchcraft trials, The Salem Witchcraft Papers; the new and now authoritative Records of the Salem Witch-Hunt, edited by Bernard Rosenthal, et. al.; Boyer and Nissenbaum's edited collection of documents, Salem-Village Witchcraft; and Salem Village's Book of Record, which contain tax records and other information relating to Salem Village. Photocopies of the original Salem Village record book and church records were examined at the Danvers Archival Center.
The Accused Witches Data Set contains information about those who were formally accused of witchcraft during the Salem episode. This means that there exists evidence of some form of direct legal involvement, such as a complaint made before civil officials, an arrest warrant, an examination, or court record. Accused witches were almost always detained in jail to await further action by a grand jury, which had the authority to indict and hold the accused for trial. Trials by a special Court of Oyer and Terminer began in June 1692. In October 1692, this court was discontinued due to mounting criticism of its methods. It was replaced by another court, the Superior Court of Judicature, which held trials from January to May 1693.
The ""Accused Witch"" column records the names of the 152 people mentioned in legal records as having been formally accused of witchcraft. Their names are alphabetically arranged. Spelling generally follows that of Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum, Salem Witchcraft Papers but has been sometimes changed in accordance with the newer Records of the Salem Witch-Hunt and other sources.
""Residence"" identifies the community in which the accused person was living when accused of witchcraft. In a few cases, the residence of an accused witch is problematic. For Elizabeth How, for example, some records cite Ipswich while others name Topsfield as her home. In such cases, the most likely residence has been used. In a few instances, the residence entry does not reflect the actual geographic relationship of the accused with the trials. George Burroughs was living in Wells, Maine, in 1692, but he had been a controversial minister in Salem Village in the early 1680s.
""Month of Accusation"" numerically expresses the month of the year in which an alleged witch was accused: ""1""=January 1692; ""6""=June 1692; and ""13""=January 1693. A negative 1 (-1) indicates that the actual month of accusation is not known with sufficient certainty to be included. Some of these ""unknowns"" can be approximated from available records, and users may choose to substitute their estimate. Users should also recognize an artificial quality to this data: those accused in one month, May (5), for example, may have been charged only a day or two before someone in June (6).
""Month of Execution"" numerically expresses the month in which an alleged witch was executed as a result of the legal process. The data do not include entries for those who died as a result of their incarceration. In one case, Giles Corey, the month of execution does record the month in which he was pressed to death for refusing to plead to the charges against him.
The Towns Data Set provides a convenient way to construct histograms of the communities whose residents were charged with witchcraft in 1692. It contains 25 columns:
Twenty-four columns record each town for which at least one formal accusation occurred (Salem Village and Salem Town are listed separately). Each cell lists the month of an accusation, numerically expressed: 1=January 1692, 2=February 1692, and so forth. The negative number, -1, indicates that the month of accusation is unknown.
A ""Bin"" column contains the range of months of witchcraft accusations, from 1 (January 1692) to 12 (December 1692), with -1 for unknown months of accusation.
Both the Pro-Parris and Anti-Parris data sets contain the same four columns:
""Name"" identifies each signer of the pro-Parris petition.
""Identification"" indicates the category in the petition under which the signer was placed.
""Sex"" indicates whether the signer was male or female.
""Sort"" locates each signer in the data set so that it can be returned to its original order.
To compare the social make-up of Salem Village's pro- and anti-Parris factions to the village's general population, download the Salem Village Data Set. The data set contains four columns:
""Name"" lists every person in Salem Village who appeared on any village tax assessments for 1690, 1695, and 1697. The 137 names are a good, though imperfect, indicator of the village's adult male population in the period of the witch hunt. Only a few women, all widows, appear. Young men not yet independent or paying taxes do not appear.
""Petition"" notes whether the taxpayer signed either the pro- or anti-Parris petition in 1695. ""NoS"" (no signature) means that the person did not sign either petition.
""Church to 1696"" indicates whether a person was a church member though 1696. No distinction is made as to whether a person was a member of the Salem Village church or another church. The list is compiled from the pro- and anti-Parris petitions as well as from the records of the Salem Village church as recorded by Samuel Parris. Additional information came from the published records of the First Church in Salem Town.
""Sort"" permits data to be easily restored to their original order after a statistical manipulation.
The Committee Yearly Data Set contains information about Salem Village's committees from 1685 to 1698, a period that covers the last years Deodat Lawson's ministry and the entire tenure of Samuel Parris. The data set contains three columns of information for each committee:
""Committee"" lists the names of committeemen for a particular year (in 1688, only four men were elected).
""Petition"" indicates whether the committeeman signed either the pro- or anti-Parris petition in 1695. ""NoS"" (no signature) means that this committeeman did not sign either petition. Signing a petition strongly suggests but does not conclusively establish a petitioner's earlier position regarding Parris or the witchcraft outbreak.
""Social"" indicates whether the committeeman was a church member or a householder. Three committeemen (William Sibley, James Smith, and Jacob Fuller) have been listed as householders in the absence of information linking them to a church.)
The Committee List Data Set provides information about all Salem Village committee members who held office from 1685 to 1698. The data set contains 18 columns:
""Committee Members"" records the names of the thirty-one villagers who held committee office from 1685-1698. They are listed in the order in which they first appeared in the village's Book of Record.
""Petition"" notes whether the committeeman signed either the pro- or anti-Parris petition in 1695. ""NoS"" (no signature) means that this committeeman did not sign either petition.
""Social"" indicates whether the committeeman was a church member or a householder. (Three committeemen, William Sibley, James Smith, and Jacob Fuller, have been listed as householders in the absence of information linking them to a church; the three did not sign either petition.)
Columns 4-17 indicate committee membership for each year.
""Sort"" permits data to be easily restored to their original order.
The Tax Comparison Data Set was compiled by listing all Salem Village taxpayers who were assessed rates in the period between 1681 and 1700. The rates are recorded in Salem Village's Book of Record (see Bibliography).
""Name"" lists in alphabetical order all assessments on Salem Village's tax lists for 1681, 1690, 1694, 1695, 1697, and 1700.
""Tax"" records the taxpayer's assessment in shillings. Since the village's revenue needs changed, the total assessment (and individual allocations) changed accordingly.
""Petition"" indicates whether the taxpayer signed either the pro- or anti-Parris petition in 1695. ""NoS"" (no signature) means that this taxpayer did not sign either petition.
""Sort"" permits data to be easily restored to their original order after a statistical manipulation.

How frequently a word occurs in a language is an important piece of information for natural language processing and linguists. In natural language processing, very frequent words tend to be less informative than less frequent one and are often removed during preprocessing. Human language users are also sensitive to word frequency. How often a word is used affects language processing in humans. For example, very frequent words are read and understood more quickly and can be understood more easily in background noise.

The contents of this data set comes from public data available on the city of Portland website. Each individual crime reported is lists the location, time and date of the incident as well as a the neighborhood in which the event occurred.
All data prior to 2015 has the same general format but the newer 2015-17 data needs to be reformatted for easier comparison since it does not match the older organizational scheme. To this end I will be adding new .csv with 2015 , 2016, and 2017 YTD data broken out. Coordinate data will also be added to make the data sets more easily comparable and mappable.
Update: I created new .csv for each year 2015-2017 changing the formatting from the Portland Police Department's tab separated values to the standard comma separated values. The pre-2015 data still isn't comparable because of the differences in the crime categorization but I will work creating some sort of key so that the full data set can be analyzed as a single batch of information.

Rats in New York City are prevalent, as in many densely populated areas. For a long time, the exact number of rats in New York City was unknown, and a common urban legend was that there were up to four times as many rats as people. In 2014, however, scientists more accurately measured the entire city's rat population to be approximately only 25% of the number of humans; i.e., there were approximately 2 million rats to New York's 8.4 million people at the time of the study.[1][2]
Content:
New York City rodent complaints can be made online, or by dialing 3-1-1, and the New York City guide Preventing Rats on Your Property discusses how the New York City Health Department inspects private and public properties for rats. Property owners that fail inspections receive a Commissioner's Order and have five days to correct the problem. If after five days the property fails a second inspection, the owner receives a Notice of Violation and can be fined. The property owner is billed for any clean-up or extermination carried out by the Health Department.

During the 2016 US presidential election, the phrase ‚Äúfake news‚Äù found its way to the forefront in news articles, tweets, and fiery online debates the world over after misleading and untrue stories proliferated rapidly. BuzzFeed News analyzed over 1,000 stories from hyperpartisan political Facebook pages selected from the right, left, and mainstream media to determine the nature and popularity of false or misleading information they shared.
Content
This dataset supports the original story ‚ÄúHyperpartisan Facebook Pages Are Publishing False And Misleading Information At An Alarming Rate‚Äù published October 20th, 2016. Here are more details on the methodology used for collecting and labeling the dataset (reproduced from the story):
More on Our Methodology and Data Limitations
‚ÄúEach of our raters was given a rotating selection of pages from each category on different days. In some cases, we found that pages would repost the same link or video within 24 hours, which caused Facebook to assign it the same URL. When this occurred, we did not log or rate the repeat post and instead kept the original date and rating. Each rater was given the same guide for how to review posts:
‚ÄúMostly True: The post and any related link or image are based on factual information and portray it accurately. This lets them interpret the event/info in their own way, so long as they do not misrepresent events, numbers, quotes, reactions, etc., or make information up. This rating does not allow for unsupported speculation or claims.
‚ÄúMixture of True and False: Some elements of the information are factually accurate, but some elements or claims are not. This rating should be used when speculation or unfounded claims are mixed with real events, numbers, quotes, etc., or when the headline of the link being shared makes a false claim but the text of the story is largely accurate. It should also only be used when the unsupported or false information is roughly equal to the accurate information in the post or link. Finally, use this rating for news articles that are based on unconfirmed information.
‚ÄúMostly False: Most or all of the information in the post or in the link being shared is inaccurate. This should also be used when the central claim being made is false.
‚ÄúNo Factual Content: This rating is used for posts that are pure opinion, comics, satire, or any other posts that do not make a factual claim. This is also the category to use for posts that are of the ‚ÄúLike this if you think...‚Äù variety.
‚ÄúIn gathering the Facebook engagement data, the API did not return results for some posts. It did not return reaction count data for two posts, and two posts also did not return comment count data. There were 70 posts for which the API did not return share count data. We also used CrowdTangle's API to check that we had entered all posts from all nine pages on the assigned days. In some cases, the API returned URLs that were no longer active. We were unable to rate these posts and are unsure if they were subsequently removed by the pages or if the URLs were returned in error.‚Äù

Here are some ideas for exploring the hyperpartisan echo chambers on Facebook:
How do left, mainstream, and right categories of Facebook pages differ in the stories they share?
Which types of stories receive the most engagement from their Facebook followers? Are videos or links more effective for engagement?

The Journal of the American Chemical Society is the premier journal published by the American Chemical Society and one of the highest ranking journals in all of chemistry. With almost 60,000 papers and over 120,000 authors this collections of papers published between 1996 and 2016, represents the current state of chemistry research.
Content
This dataset is presented in 3 database tables, one of published articles, and one of all authors, with a further table relating authors to the journal articles they have published.
Update 21-12-2017: The previous data was collected by a top level scrape of the table of contents pages from the journal.
A couple of months ago I performed a page-level scrape and then forgot about it, but I had some positive reactions to the data-set this week, so I have processed some of the data (although more remains, the raw output from the scrape is an 18 GB csv file).
This new data updates the Articles table to contain many more data fields, including the paper abstract, number of citations and page views (page views are a relatively new feature, so is probably not for the lifetime of some of the older papers).
One interesting project for this data would be to look at the term frequencies in the abstracts of the papers, and use that to see how the focus of chemistry research has changed over the years.
If it is interesting to people, I have the following unprocessed data: - Articles citing papers in this database inc, Title, Journal, Year and Author list - Institutions of authors for each papers (this data is very complicated and requires some difficult parsing)

This data was scraped from the Table of Contents section of the JACS website and is available online publicly.

Observations of particles much smaller than us, and various understandings of those particles, have propelled mankind forward in ways once impossible to imagine. ""The elements"" are what we call the sequential patterns in which some of these particles manifest themselves.
As a chemistry student and a coder, I wanted to do what came naturally to me and make my class a bit easier by coding/automating my way around some of the tedious work involved with calculations. Unfortunately, it seems that chemical-related datasets are not yet a thing which have been conveniently formatted into downloadable databases (as far as my research went). I decided that the elements would be a good place to start data collection, so I did that, and I'd like to see if this is useful to others as well.
Other related data sets I'd like to coalesce are some large amount of standard entropies and enthalpies of various compounds, and many of the data sets from the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics. I also think as many diagrams as possible should be documented in a way that can be manipulated and read via code.

Included here are three data sets. Each data set I have included is in three different formats (CSV, JSON, Excel), for a total of nine files.
Table of the Elements:
This is the primary data set.

This file contains a selection of census data taken from the ACS DP03 and DP05 tables. Things like total population, racial/ethnic demographic information, employment and commuting characteristics, and more are contained here. There is a great deal of additional data in the raw tables retrieved from the US Census Bureau website, so I could easily add more fields if there is enough interest.
I obtained data for individual census tracts, which typically contain several thousand residents.
census_block_loc.csv
For this file, I used an online FCC census block lookup tool to retrieve the census block code for a 200 x 200 grid containing New York City and a bit of the surrounding area. This file contains the coordinates and associated census block codes along
with the state and county names to make things a bit more readable to users.
Each census tract is split into a number of blocks, so one must extract the census tract code from the block code.

"Vehicle Fuel Economy Estimates, 1984-2017",Which makes and models have the highest city and highway MPG?,US Environmental Protection Agency,12,"Version 1,2017-01-31",vehicles,CSV,11 MB,CC0,"4,716 views",664 downloads,9 kernels,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/epa/fuel-economy,"Content
The purpose of EPA‚Äôs fuel economy estimates is to provide a reliable basis for comparing vehicles. Most vehicles in the database (other than plug-in hybrids) have three fuel economy estimates: a ‚Äúcity‚Äù estimate that represents urban driving, in which a vehicle is started in the morning (after being parked all night) and driven in stop-and-go traffic; a ‚Äúhighway‚Äù estimate that represents a mixture of rural and interstate highway driving in a warmed-up vehicle, typical of longer trips in free-flowing traffic; and a ‚Äúcombined‚Äù estimate that represents a combination of city driving (55%) and highway driving (45%). Estimates for all vehicles are based on laboratory testing under standardized conditions to allow for fair comparisons.
The database provides annual fuel cost estimates, rounded to the nearest $50, for each vehicle. The estimates are based on the assumptions that you travel 15,000 miles per year (55% under city driving conditions and 45% under highway conditions) and that fuel costs $2.33/gallon for regular unleaded gasoline, $2.58/gallon for mid-grade unleaded gasoline, and $2.82/gallon for premium.
EPA‚Äôs fuel economy values are good estimates of the fuel economy a typical driver will achieve under average driving conditions and provide a good basis to compare one vehicle to another. However, your fuel economy may be slightly higher or lower than EPA‚Äôs estimates. Fuel economy varies, sometimes significantly, based on driving conditions, driving style, and other factors.

The Cingranelli-Richards human rights database contains quantitative information on government recognition of 15 internationally recognized human rights in more than 200 countries from 1981-2011. It includes measures of the practices of governments that allow or impede citizens who wish to exercise their physical integrity rights like the rights not to be tortured, summarily executed, disappeared, or imprisoned for political beliefs; civil liberties such as free speech, freedom of association and assembly, freedom of movement, freedom of religion, and the right to participate in the selection of government leaders; employment rights; and rights of women to equal treatment politically, economically, and socially. The database is designed for use by scholars and students who seek to test theories about the causes and consequences of human rights violations, as well as policy makers and analysts who seek to estimate the human rights effects of a wide variety of institutional changes and public policies including democratization, economic aid, military aid, structural adjustment, and humanitarian intervention.
The primary source of information about human rights practices is obtained from the annual United States Department of State‚Äôs Country Reports on Human Rights Practices. Coders are instructed to use this source for all variables. For a group of four rights known as ""Physical Integrity Rights"" (the rights to freedom from extrajudicial killing, disappearance, torture, and political imprisonment), coders use Amnesty International‚Äôs Annual Report in addition the Department of State reports. If discrepancies exist between the two sources, coders are instructed to treat the Amnesty International report as authoritative; some scholars believe that this step is necessary to remove a potential bias in favor of American allies.

For instance, according to the Division of Fire Safety Engineering at Lund University, ""Almost every day between one and two school fires occur in Sweden. In most cases arson is the cause of the fire."" The associated costs can be up to a billion SEK (around 120 million USD) per year.
It is hard to say why these fires are so common in Sweden compared to other countries, and this dataset doesn't address that question - but could it be possible, within a Swedish context, to find out which properties and indicators of Swedish towns (municipalities, to be exact) might be related to a high frequency of school fires?
I have collected data on school fire cases in Sweden between 1998 and 2014 through a web site with official statistics from the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (https://ida.msb.se/ida2#page=a0087). At least at the time when I collected the data, there was no API to allow easy access to schools fire data, so I had to collect them using a quasi-manual process, downloading XLSX report generated from the database year by year, after which I joined these with an R script into a single table of school fire cases where the suspected reason was arson. (Full details on the data acquisition process are available.)
The number of such cases is reported for each municipality (of which there are currently 290) and year (i e each row is a unique municipality/year combination). The population at the time is also reported.
As a complement to these data, I provide a list of municipal KPI:s (key performance indicators) from 1998 to 2014. There are thousands of these KPI:s, and it would be a futile task for me to try to translate the descriptions from Swedish to English, although I might take a stab at translating a small subset of them at some point. These KPIs were extracted from Kolada (a database of Swedish municipality and county council statistics) by repeatedly querying its API (https://github.com/Hypergene/kolada).
I'd be very interested to hear if anyone finds some interesting correlations between schools fire cases and municipality indicators!"

The Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative (CDLI) is an international digital library project aimed at putting text and images of an estimated 500,000 recovered cuneiform tablets created from between roughly 3350 BC and the end of the pre-Christian era online. The initiative is a joint project of the University of California, Los Angeles, the University of Oxford, and the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, Berlin.

What is Cuneiform?
Cuneiform script, one of the earliest systems of writing, was invented by the Sumerians. It is distinguished by its wedge-shaped marks on clay tablets, made by means of a blunt reed for a stylus. The name cuneiform itself simply means ""wedge shaped"".
Cuneiform is not a language, nor is it an alphabet. Cuneiform uses between 600-1000 characters to write words or syllables. It has been used by many different cultural groups to represent many different languages, but it was primarily used to write Sumerian and Akkadian. Deciphering cuneiform is very difficult to this day, though the difficulty varies depending on the language.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform_script
What is Assyriology?
Assyriology is the study of the languages, history, and culture of the people who used the ancient writing system called cuneiform. Cuneiform was used primarily in an area called the Near East, centred on Mesopotamia (modern Iraq and eastern Syria) where cuneiform was invented, but including the Northern Levant (Western Syria and Lebanon), parts of Anatolia, and western Iran. The sources for Assyriology are all archaeological, and include both inscribed and uninscribed objects. Most Assyriologists focus on the rich textual record from the ancient Near East, and specialise in either the study of language, literature, or history of the ancient Near East.
Assyriology began as an academic discipline with the recovery of the monuments of ancient Assyria, and the decipherment of cuneiform, in the middle of the 19th century. Large numbers of archaeological objects, including texts, were brought to museums in Europe and later the US, following the early excavations of Nineveh, Kalhu, Babylon, Girsu, Assur and so forth. Today Assyriology is studied in universities across the globe, both as an undergraduate and a graduate subject, and knowledge from the ancient Near East informs students of numerous other disciplines such as the History of Science, Archaeology, Classics, Biblical studies and more."

First, I've removed re-tweets, second, I've removed duplicates (not sure why Twitter gave me them in the first place), third, I've made sure the tweet contained the words 'good morning' (some tweets were returned that didn't have the text in for some reason) and fourth, I've removed all the tweets that didn't have a longitude and latitude included.

Keystroke Dynamics,Typing patterns for keystroke authentication,Kumar Nityan Suman,12,"Version 1,2017-03-11",computer security,Other,4 MB,CC0,"4,277 views",732 downloads,10 kernels,,https://www.kaggle.com/knityansuman/keystroke-dynamics,"Context
Keystroke dynamics is the study of whether people can be distinguished by their typing rhythms, much like handwriting is used to identify the author of a written text. Possible applications include acting as an electronic fingerprint, or in an access-control mechanism. A digital fingerprint would tie a person to a computer-based crime in the same manner that a physical fingerprint ties a person to the scene of a physical crime. Access control could incorporate keystroke dynamics both by requiring a legitimate user to type a password with the correct rhythm, and by continually authenticating that user while they type on the keyboard.
Content
The data are arranged as a table with 34 columns. Each row of data corresponds to the timing information for a single repetition of the password by a single subject. The first column, subject, is a unique identifier for each subject (e.g., s002 or s057). Even though the data set contains 51 subjects, the identifiers do not range from s001 to s051; subjects have been assigned unique IDs across a range of keystroke experiments, and not every subject participated in every experiment. For instance, Subject 1 did not perform the password typing task and so s001 does not appear in the data set. The second column, sessionIndex, is the session in which the password was typed (ranging from 1 to 8). The third column, rep, is the repetition of the password within the session (ranging from 1 to 50).
The remaining 31 columns present the timing information for the password. The name of the column encodes the type of timing information. Column names of the form H.key designate a hold time for the named key (i.e., the time from when key was pressed to when it was released). Column names of the form DD.key1.key2 designate a key down-key down time for the named digraph (i.e., the time from when key1 was pressed to when key2 was pressed). Column names of the form UD.key1.key2 designate a key up-key down time for the named digraph (i.e., the time from when key1 was released to when key2 was pressed). Note that UD times can be negative, and that H times and UD times add up to DD times.
Consider the following one-line example of what you will see in the data:
subject sessionIndex rep H.period DD.period.t UD.period.t ... s002 1 1 0.1491 0.3979 0.2488 ...
The example presents typing data for subject 2, session 1, repetition 1. The period key was held down for 0.1491 seconds (149.1 milliseconds); the time between pressing the period key and the t key (key down-key down time) was 0.3979 seconds; the time between releasing the period and pressing the t key (key up-key down time) was 0.2488 seconds; and so on

To make measurable progress in the field of keystroke dynamics, i shared data. The anomaly-detection task was to discriminate between the typing of a genuine user trying to gain legitimate access to his or her account, and the typing of an impostor trying to gain access illegitimately to that same account. Our intent with this is to share our resources‚Äîthe typing data, with the research community, and to answer questions that they (or you) might have.
For starters: 1. The typing patterns of different users. 2. The changing typing styles of a user over different attempts. 3. The difference in typing of left-side keys and right-side keys on the keyboard.

How was it collected?
Contributors looked at thousands of social media messages from US Senators and other American politicians to classify their content. Messages were broken down into audience (national or the tweeter‚Äôs constituency), bias (neutral/bipartisan, or biased/partisan), and finally tagged as the actual substance of the message itself (options ranged from informational, announcement of a media appearance, an attack on another candidate, etc.)

politics",CSV,172 MB,CC0,"2,581 views",219 downloads,8 kernels,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/fec/independent-political-ad-spending,"What is an Independent Expenditure?
Independent expenditures are what some refer to as ""hard money"" in politics -- spending on ads that specifically mention a candidate (either supporting or opposing). The money for these ads must come from PACs that are independent of the candidate and campaign, and the PACs cannot coordinate with the candidate.
The Federal Election Commission (FEC) collects information on independent expenditures to ensure payers' independence from candidates.
What can we look at?
I'm super interested to see how much spending has increased over the years. The FEC data only goes back to 2004, and it may be the case that the older data is spotty, but I don't doubt that political spending has gone up in the past few years (the 2016 Presidential campaign reportedly involved the most political money since the 1970s).

Despite being pathogens of global public health importance, knowledge of their vectors‚Äô global distribution remains patchy and sparse.
A global geographic database of known occurrences of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus between 1960 and 2014 was compiled. The database, which comprises occurrence data linked to point or polygon locations, was derived from peer-reviewed literature and unpublished studies including national entomological surveys and expert networks. The authors describe all data collection processes, as well as geo-positioning methods, database management and quality-control procedures in their 2015 paper cited below.
This is the first comprehensive global database of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus occurrence, consisting of 19,930 and 22,137 geo-positioned occurrence records respectively. The dataset can be used for a variety of mapping and spatial analyses of the vectors and, by inference, the diseases they transmit.

A Hadith is a report describing the words, actions, intentions or habits of the last Prophet and Messenger Muhammed (Peace Be Upon Him). The term literally means report, account or narrative.
·π¢a·∏•ƒ´·∏• al-BukhƒÅrƒ´ (ÿµÿ≠Ÿäÿ≠ ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿÆÿßÿ±Ÿä), is one of the six major hadith collections books. It was collected by a Muslim scholar Imam Muhammad al-Bukhari, after being transmitted orally for generations. There are 7,658 full hadiths in this collection narrated by 1,755 narrators/transmitters.
Imam Bukhari finished his work around 846 A.D.
Content
The two main sources of data regarding hadith are works of hadith and works containing biographical information about hadith narrators. The dataset contains 7,658 hadiths in Arabic and the names of 1,755 transmitters. Imam Bukhari followed the following criterion to include a hadith in this book.
Quality and soundness of chain of narrators - the lifetime of a narrator should overlap with the lifetime of the authority from whom he narrates.
Verifiable - it should be verifiable that narrators have met with their source persons. They should also expressly state that they obtained the narrative from these authorities.
Piousness ‚Äì he only accepted the narratives from only those who, according to his knowledge, not only believed in Islam but practiced its teachings.

Inspiration
Here are some ideas worth exploring:
The traditional criteria for determining if a hadith is Sahih (authentic) requires that there should be an uninterrupted chain of narrators; that all those narrators should be highly reliable and there should not be any hidden defects. Can we make a social network graph of all the narrators and then timestamp it with their age and era to see who overlaps who?
The name of a transmitter mentioned in a given hadith is not the full name, and many transmitters have similar names. So identifying who is the transmitter of a given hadith based on the names mentioned in the text might be a good problem to tackle
Can we analyze the chains of transmitters for entire collections using Neo4j or some other graph database
There exist different chains that reports the same hadith with little variation of words, can you identify those
Can you link the text with other external data sources?
Can we produce the word cloud for each chapter of the book?
Can we train a neural network to authenticate if the hadith is real or not?
Can we find out the specific style or vocabulary of each narrator?
Can we develop a system for comparing variant wordings for the same hadith to identify how reliable a given transmitter is.
Please also help me extend this dataset. If you have any other hadith book in CSV or text format, please send me a message and I will add."

It is important to know if a patient will be readmitted in some hospital. The reason is that you can change the treatment, in order to avoid a readmission.
In this database, you have 3 different outputs:
No readmission;
A readmission in less than 30 days (this situation is not good, because maybe your treatment was not appropriate);
A readmission in more than 30 days (this one is not so good as well the last one, however, the reason can be the state of the patient.
In this context, you can see different objective functions for the problem. You can try to figure out situations where the patient will not be readmitted, or if their are going to be readmitted in less than 30 days (because the problem can the the treatment), etc... Make your choice and let's help them creating new approaches for the problem.

The Panama Paper Case is the most publicized case in the history of Pakistan. It was heard before the Supreme Court of Pakistan between November 1st 2016 to February 23, 2017. It alleges the corruption, money laundering and wrong doing by the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif.
After subsequent formation of Joint Investigation Committee and its recommendations, court finally disqualified the prime minister on July 28th 2017. Since then, there is a hue and cry in the media by the incumbent political party and one question the ex-Prime Minister is keep asking is ""Mujhe Kiyun Nikala (Why They Kicked Me Out). It seems the poor man has no idea what happened and why.
Pakistan is a country of 207 million people according to the recent census and no one is giving him the answer of his question. I feel pity for the ex-Prime Minister, and thought to launch this dataset to call my fellow data scientists to run the kernels, dig out the hidden meanings, find patterns and linkages with off-shore companies (I've posted the complete Panama Papers in another dataset as well) to help him understand ""Unhen Kiyun Nikala - Why did he kicked out?""

While the physiological response of humans to emotional events or stimuli is well-investigated for many modalities (like EEG, skin resistance, ...), surprisingly little is known about the exhalation of so-called Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) at quite low concentrations in response to such stimuli. VOCs are molecules of relatively small mass that quickly evaporate or sublimate and can be detected in the air that surrounds us. The project introduces a new field of application for data mining, where trace gas responses of people reacting on-line to films shown in cinemas (or movie theaters) are related to the semantic content of the films themselves. To do so, we measured the VOCs from a movie theater over a whole month in intervals of thirty seconds, and annotated the screened films by a controlled vocabulary compiled from multiple sources.
Content
The data set consists of two parts, first the measured VOCs, and second the information about the movies. The VOCs are given in the file TOF_CO2_data_30sec.arff which is simply the time of the measurement in the first column, then all measured 400+ VOCs in the other columns. Roughly one measurement was carried out every 30 seconds. The information which movies were shown is given in the file screenings.csv. It gives start time, end time, movie title and how many visitors were in the screening. Additionally, the folder labels_aggregated give a consensus labelling of multiple annotators for the movies. The labels describe the scenes, each label represented by a row, then each column showing if the label is active (1) or not (0). This is available for 6 movies in the data set.
The goal of our initial analysis was the identification of markers, that is, finding certain VOCs that have a relation to certain labels and therefore emotions. For example, given the scene label blood, is there any increase or decrease in the concentration of a specific VOC?

While the first analysis gave already interesting results, we believe that this data set has a high potential for further analysis. We are currently working on increasing the size of the data. Additionally, multiple follow-up publications are being prepared. There are many posssible tasks, we focus mainly on the identification of markers in the VOC data, but there are many potential interesting findings in the data set. Are movies related based on the VOCs? Could we identify similar scenes based on the VOCs?"

In 2013 alone, international migrants sent $413 billion home to families and friends. This money is known as ""remittance money"", and the total is more than three times that afforded by total global foreign aid ($135 billion). Remittances are traditionally associated with poor migrants moving outside of their home country to find work, supporting their families back home on their foreign wages; as a result, they make up a significant part of the economic picture for many developing countries in the world.
This dataset, published by the World Bank, provides estimates of 2016 remittance movements between various countries. It also provides historical data on the flow of such money going back to 1970.
For a look at how remittances play into the global economy, watch ""The hidden force in global economics: sending money home"".
Content
This dataset contains three files:
bilateral-remittance.csv --- Estimated remittances between world countries in the year 2016.
remittance-inflow.csv --- Historical remittance money inflow into world countries since 1970. Typically high in developing nations.
remittance-outflow.csv --- Historical remittance money outflow from world countries since 1970. Typically high in more developed nations.
All monetary values are in terms of millions of US dollars.
For more information on how this data was generated and calculated, refer to the World Bank Remittance Data FAQ.
Acknowledgements
This dataset is a republished version of three of the tables published by the World Bank which has been slightly cleaned up for use on Kaggle. For the original source, and other complimentary materials, check out the dataset home page.
Inspiration
What is the historical trend in remittance inflows and outflows for various countries? How does this relate to the developmental character of the countries in question?
What countries send to most money abroad? What countries receive the most money from abroad? Try combining this dataset with a demographics dataset to see what countries are most and least reliant on income from abroad.
How far do workers migrate for a job? Are they staying near home, or going half the world away? Are there any surprising facts about who send money to who?"

The full Memetracker dataset has observations broken into months. Because of size considerations, however, this version consists of one-half of a month: the first 15 days of Memetracker observations from November 2008.
About
Memetracker tracks the quotes and phrases that appear most frequently over time across the entire online news spectrum. This makes it possible to see how different stories compete for news and blog coverage each day, and how certain stories persist while others fade quickly.
Overall Memetracker tracks more than 17 million different phrases and about 54% of the total phrase/quote mentions appear on blogs and 46% in news media.

internet",CSV,484 MB,Other,"2,837 views",180 downloads,4 kernels,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/colemaclean/subreddit-interactions,"Context
The dataset is a csv file compiled using a python scrapper developed using Reddit's PRAW API. The raw data is a list of 3-tuples of [username,subreddit,utc timestamp]. Each row represents a single comment made by the user, representing about 5 days worth of Reddit data. Note that the actual comment text is not included, only the user, subreddit and comment timestamp of the users comment. The goal of the dataset is to provide a lens in discovering user patterns from reddit meta-data alone. The original use case was to compile a dataset suitable for training a neural network in developing a subreddit recommender system. That final system can be found here
A very unpolished EDA for the dataset can be found here. Note the published dataset is only half of the one used in the EDA and recommender system, to meet kaggle's 500MB size limitation.
Content
user - The username of the person submitting the comment
subreddit - The title of the subreddit the user made the comment in
utc_stamp - the utc timestamp of when the user made the comment
Acknowledgements
The dataset was compiled as part of a school project. The final project report, with my collaborators, can be found here
Inspiration
We were able to build a pretty cool subreddit recommender with the dataset. A blog post for it can be found here, and the stand alone jupyter notebook for it here. Our final model is very undertuned, so there's definitely improvements to be made there, but I think there are many other cool data projects and visualizations that could be built from this dataset. One example would be to analyze the spread of users through the Reddit ecosystem, whether the average user clusters in close communities, or traverses wide and far to different corners. If you do end up building something on this, please share! And have fun!

sound technology",CSV,668 KB,CC4,"5,074 views",414 downloads,5 kernels,,https://www.kaggle.com/aniruddhaachar/audio-features,"Context
This data was compiled as part of our undergrad project that used machine learning to classify songs based on themes or activities songs are associated with. For the project we, four activities were choose.
Dinner: Songs that sound good when played in a dinner setting or at a restaurant.
Sleep: Songs that promote sleep when they are played.
Party: Songs that sound good when played at a party.
Workout: Songs that sound good when one is exercising/ working out.
The collection of data started with collecting playlist details form Spotify. Spotify web API was used for the collection of the playlist of each category. Track title, album name and artist names were used to extract low level and high level Audio features like MFCC, Spectral centroid, Spectral Roll-off, Spectral Bandwidth, Tempo, Spectral Contrast and Root Mean Square Energy of the songs. For ease of computation, the mean of the values were calculated and added to the tables.
Data was also curated using Spotify's audio analysis API. A larger set of songs is part of this data set.
Content
The data set has eight tables.
Four tables with names playlist_audio_features have the signal processing features like MFCC, spectral centroid etc.
Four more tables with names playlist_spotify_features have the data extracted from Spotify's audio feature API. These tables have larger number of features. The data set size is quite large.
Description of the ""playlist""_audio_features columns:
The first column has the simple integer id if the track. (This id is local to that file).
The second column has the name of the track.
The third column name mfcc has the mean of the calculated MFCC for that track. 20 MFC coefficients were extracted from one frame of the track.
The forth column is named scem: This is the mean of Spectral centroid. Spectral centroid was calculated for each frame.
The fifth column is named scom: This is the mean of Spectral contrast. Spectral contrast was calculated for each frame.
The sixth column is named srom: This is the mean of Spectral Roll-off. Spectral roll-off was calculated for each frame.
The seventh column is named sbwm: This is the mean of Spectral Bandwidth. Spectral Bandwidth was calculated for each frame.
The eight column is name tempo: This is the estimated tempo of the track.
The ninth column is name rmse: This is the mean of the RSME was calculated for each frame.
Description of the _spotify_features columns:
id: This is the Spotify id of the track.
name: This is the name of the track.
url: This is a Spotify uri of the track.
artist: This is a one or more artists who worked on the track. 5-13: Description of each of the column can be found at https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-audio-features/

This dataset is a collection of biomedicine and life science bibliometric data obtained from MEDLINE.
The data covers 26,759,425 papers available thought MEDLINE from 1946 through 2016.
This dataset has been created by processing the publicly available data dump at nih.gov. The data dump consists of ca 23 Million xml articles. From these xml files I have extracted some meta data into more accessible csv files. The processed csvs contain both very basic metadata (i.e. creation date, number of authors, and ids) and the ""Medical Subject Headings"" MeSH classification.
The dataset is divided in two files,
paper_details.csv
mesh.csv
The paper_details.csv file contains the following columns:
pmid: this is the unique article identified within the dataset, it is also the official identifier used on PubMed
doi: digital object identifier, this id allows to uniquely identify a paper through the widely used DOI scheme
num_authors: number of authors on the paper
year: year the document has been created
month: month the document has been created
day: day the document has been created
title: title of the document
issn: the ISSN number of the journal the document has been published in
issn_type: printed or electronic
volume: volume of the journal the document has been published in
issue: issue of the journal the document has been published in
journal_title: Name of Journal the document has been published in
journal_title_iso: ISO abbreviation of the journal title.
5 GB, and 26,759,425 rows
In the mesh.csv file the following fields are available:
pmid: this is the unique article identified within the dataset, it is also the official identifier used on PubMed
descriptor_id: the id of the MeSH descriptor for the given document
descriptor_name: name of the MeSH descriptor
descriptor_major_topic: Y/N, indicate if the descriptor is a major topic in MeSH
qualifiers: a list of MeSH qualifiers (aka subheadings). Subheadings are attached to MeSH headings to describe a specific aspect of a concept.
NB: a document can and has more often then not more then one MeSH descriptor associated to it.
11 GB, and 247,415,857 rows

How to open the files:
Due to the limit on Kaggle for files to be at most 500MB in size, the files have been split. More specifically the two files have been compressed with zip and split. To recombine them do the following. If you are on Linux/MacOS enter the following commands in the terminal
cat paper_details.csv.zip.part-* > papers_details.csv.zip
unzip papers_details.csv.zip

The repository contains data on party strength for each state as shown on each state's corresponding party strength Wikipedia page (for example, here is Virginia )
Each state has a table of a detailed summary of the state of its governing and representing bodies on Wikipedia but there is no data set that collates these entries. I scraped each state's Wikipedia table and collated the entries into a single dataset. The data are stored in the state_party_strength.csv and state_party_strength_cleaned.csv. The code that generated the file can be found in corresponding Python notebooks.
Data contents:
The data contain information from 1980 on each state's: 1. governor and party 2. state house and senate composition 3. state representative composition in congress 4. electoral votes
Clean Version
Data in the clean version has been cleaned and processed substantially. Namely: - all columns now contain homogenous data within the column - names and Wiki-citations have been removed - only the party counts and party identification have been left The notebook that created this file is here
Uncleaned Data Version
The data contained herein have not been altered from their Wikipedia tables except in two instances: - Forced column names to be in accord across states - Any needed data modifications (ie concatenated string columns) to retain information when combining columns
To use the data:
Please note that the right encoding for the dataset is ""ISO-8859-1"", not 'utf-8' though in future versions I will try to fix that to make it more accessible.
This means that you will likely have to perform further data wrangling prior to doing any substantive analysis. The notebook that has been used to create this data file is located here
Raw scraped data
The raw scraped data can be found in the pickle. This file contains a Python dictionary where each key is a US state name and each element is the raw scraped table in Pandas DataFrame format.
Hope it proves as useful to you in analyzing/using political patterns at the state level in the US for political and policy research."

The finalized Global Firepower ranking relies on over 50 factors to determine a given nation's PowerIndex ('PwrIndx') score. Our formula allows smaller, though more technologically-advanced, nations to compete with larger, lesser-developed ones. Modifiers (in the form of bonuses and penalties) are added to further refine the list. Some items to observe in regards to the finalized ranking:
Ranking does not simply rely on the total number of weapons available to any one country but rather focuses on weapon diversity within the number totals to provide a better balance of firepower available (i.e. fielding 100 minesweepers does not equal the strategic and tactical value of fielding 10 aircraft carriers).
Nuclear stockpiles are NOT taken into account but recognized / suspected nuclear powers receive a bonus.
Geographical factors, logistical flexibility, natural resources and local industry influence the final ranking.
Available manpower is a key consideration; nations with large populations tend to rank higher.
Land-locked nations are NOT penalized for lack of a navy; naval powers ARE penalized for lack of diversity in available assets.
NATO allies receive a slight bonus due to the theoretical sharing of resources.
Current political / military leadership is NOT taken into account.
For 2017 there are a total of 133 countries included in the GFP database.

Data Files
I already added day-of-year, year, weekday and time of day to the data for easier handling.
Brightness
These time-stamped values resemble the brightness readings. They range from dark (low numbers) to bright day light (high numbers).
The brightness nightly mean values differ. The reasons are: Christmas decoration during the winter, and solar lights being set up some time in mid April this year.
Contacts
These data indicate door and window openings. They are time-stamped. The boolean value isClosed indicates wether the contact has been closed.
Motion
There is a motion sensor at the front door which indicates movement. Movement detections also are time-stamped data.

‚ÄúCompositionality‚Äù is a concept from linguistics where the meaning of a phrase is made up of the meaning of each of its individual words. So ‚Äúthe red apple‚Äù refers, literally, to an apple that is red. Sometimes when you combine words, however, the meaning of the phrase isn‚Äôt the same as the combined meanings of the individual words. ‚ÄúThe Big Apple‚Äù, for example, means ‚ÄúNew York City‚Äù, not a literal large apple.
This dataset contains human judgements of the compositionality of common English phrases with two nouns.
Content:
This dataset contains two files: summary data of the human judgements and the annotations by individual judges. All judgements are on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 being ‚Äúnot literal‚Äù and 5 being ‚Äúliteral‚Äù.

San Francisco Crime Classification,12 Years of Crime Reports Across San Francisco,Kaggle,11,"Version 1,2017-01-13",,CSV,208 MB,Other,"2,091 views",174 downloads,2 kernels,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/san-francisco-crime-classification,"Context
From 1934 to 1963, San Francisco was infamous for housing some of the world's most notorious criminals on the inescapable island of Alcatraz. Today, the city is known more for its tech scene than its criminal past. But, with rising wealth inequality, housing shortages, and a proliferation of expensive digital toys riding BART to work, there is no scarcity of crime in the city by the bay. From Sunset to SOMA, and Marina to Excelsior, this dataset provides nearly 12 years of crime reports from across all of San Francisco's neighborhoods.
This dataset was featured in our completed playground competition entitled San Francisco Crime Classification. The goals of the competition were to:
predict the category of crime that occurred, given the time and location
visualize the city and crimes (see Mapping and Visualizing Violent Crime for inspiration)
Content
This dataset contains incidents derived from SFPD Crime Incident Reporting system. The data ranges from 1/1/2003 to 5/13/2015. The training set and test set rotate every week, meaning week 1,3,5,7... belong to test set, week 2,4,6,8 belong to training set. There are 9 variables:
Dates - timestamp of the crime incident
Category - category of the crime incident (only in train.csv).
Descript - detailed description of the crime incident (only in train.csv)
DayOfWeek - the day of the week
PdDistrict - name of the Police Department District

Electoral Integrity in 2016 US Election,How did 700+ experts perceive the integrity of the presidential election?,Harvard University,11,"Version 1,2017-02-09",politics,CSV,571 KB,CC0,"1,777 views",198 downloads,3 kernels,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/harvard-university/electoral-integrity,"Context
Electoral integrity refers to international standards and global norms governing the appropriate conduct of elections. These standards have been endorsed in a series of authoritative conventions, treaties, protocols, and guidelines by agencies of the international community and apply universally to all countries throughout the electoral cycle, including during the pre-electoral period, the campaign, on polling day, and in its aftermath.
Content
The Perceptions of Electoral Integrity (PEI) survey asks experts to evaluate elections according to 49 indicators, grouped into eleven categories reflecting the whole electoral cycle. The PEI dataset is designed to provide a comprehensive, systematic and reliable way to monitor the quality of elections worldwide. It includes disaggregated scores for each of the individual indicators, summary indices for the eleven dimensions of electoral integrity, and a PEI index score out of 100 to summarize the overall integrity of the election.

"Presidential Pardons, 1900-2017",Petitions for executive clemency granted and denied by American presidents,Department of Justice,11,"Version 2,2017-01-20|Version 1,2017-01-19",,CSV,8 KB,CC0,"2,695 views",217 downloads,12 kernels,,https://www.kaggle.com/doj/presidential-pardons,"Context
On April 23, 2014, the Department of Justice, at the behest of President Obama, announced the Clemency Initiative, inviting petitions for commutation of sentence from nonviolent offenders who, among other criteria, likely would have received substantially lower sentences if convicted of the same offenses today. As expected, the announcement resulted in a record number of petitions ‚Äì including thousands of petitions involving crimes not included in the initiative, such as terrorism, murder, sex crimes, public corruption, and financial fraud.
In the federal system, commutation of sentence and pardon are different forms of executive clemency, which is a broad term that applies to the President‚Äôs constitutional power to exercise leniency toward persons who have committed federal crimes.
A commutation of sentence reduces a sentence, either totally or partially, that is then being served, but it does not change the conviction, signify innocence, or remove civil disabilities from the criminal conviction. A commutation may include remission (or release) of the financial obligations that are imposed as part of a sentence, such as payment of a fine or restitution; a remission applies only to the part of the financial obligation that has not already been paid. To be eligible to apply for commutation of sentence, a person must have reported to prison to begin serving his sentence and may not be challenging his conviction in the courts.
A pardon is an expression of the President‚Äôs forgiveness and is granted in recognition of the applicant‚Äôs acceptance of responsibility for the crime and established good conduct for a significant period of time after conviction or completion of sentence. It does not signify innocence. It does, however, remove civil disabilities ‚Äì such as restrictions on the right to vote, hold state or local office, or sit on a jury ‚Äì imposed because of the conviction. A person is not eligible to apply for a presidential pardon until a minimum of five years has elapsed since his release from any form of confinement imposed upon him as part of a sentence for his most recent criminal conviction.
Acknowledgements
The data was compiled and published by the Office of the Pardon Attorney. The Office of the Pardon Attorney receives and reviews petitions for all forms of executive clemency, including pardon, commutation (reduction) of sentence, remission of fine or restitution, and reprieve, initiates the necessary investigations of clemency requests, and prepares the report and recommendation of the Attorney General to the President."

The president can declare an emergency for any occasion or instance when the President determines federal assistance is needed. Emergency declarations supplement State and local or Indian tribal government efforts in providing emergency services, such as the protection of lives, property, public health, and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in any part of the United States. The total amount of assistance provided for in a single emergency may not exceed $5 million.
The president can declare a major disaster for any natural event, including any hurricane, tornado, storm, high water, wind-driven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm, or drought, or, regardless of cause, fire, flood, or explosion, that the President determines has caused damage of such severity that it is beyond the combined capabilities of state and local governments to respond. A major disaster declaration provides a wide range of federal assistance programs for individuals and public infrastructure, including funds for both emergency and permanent work.

Malaria is one of the world's most devastating diseases, not least because it largely affects some of the poorest people. Over the past 15 years malaria rates and mortality have dropped (http://www.who.int/malaria/media/world-malaria-report-2016/en/), but there is still a long way to go. Understanding the data is generally one of the most important steps in solving any large problem. I'm excited to see what the Kaggle community can find out about the global trends in malaria over this period, and if we can find out anything about the impact of organisations such as the AMF."

The CalCOFI data set represents the longest (1949-present) and most complete (more than 50,000 sampling stations) time series of oceanographic and larval fish data in the world. It includes abundance data on the larvae of over 250 species of fish; larval length frequency data and egg abundance data on key commercial species; and oceanographic and plankton data. The physical, chemical, and biological data collected at regular time and space intervals quickly became valuable for documenting climatic cycles in the California Current and a range of biological responses to them. CalCOFI research drew world attention to the biological response to the dramatic Pacific-warming event in 1957-58 and introduced the term ‚ÄúEl Ni√±o‚Äù into the scientific literature.
The California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) are a unique partnership of the California Department of Fish & Wildlife, NOAA Fisheries Service and Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The organization was formed in 1949 to study the ecological aspects of the sardine population collapse off California. Today our focus has shifted to the study of the marine environment off the coast of California, the management of its living resources, and monitoring the indicators of El Nino and climate change. CalCOFI conducts quarterly cruises off southern & central California, collecting a suite of hydrographic and biological data on station and underway. Data collected at depths down to 500 m include: temperature, salinity, oxygen, phosphate, silicate, nitrate and nitrite, chlorophyll, transmissometer, PAR, C14 primary productivity, phytoplankton biodiversity, zooplankton biomass, and zooplankton biodiversity.

If you've ever had to typeset mathematical expressions, you might have thought: wouldn‚Äôt it be great if I could just take a picture of a handwritten expression and have it be recognized automatically? This dataset has all the data you‚Äôll need to build a system to do just that.
Description
The dataset provide more than 11,000 expressions handwritten by hundreds of writers from different countries, merging the data sets from 4 CROHME competitions. Writers were asked to copy printed expressions from a corpus of expressions. The corpus has been designed to cover the diversity proposed by the different tasks and chosen from an existing math corpus and from expressions embedded in Wikipedia pages. Different devices have been used (different digital pen technologies, white-board input device, tablet with sensible screen), thus different scales and resolutions are used. The dataset provides only the on-line signal.
In the last competition CROHME 2013 the test part is completely original and the train part is using 5 existing data sets:
MathBrush (University of Waterloo),
HAMEX (University of Nantes),
MfrDB (Czech Technical University),
ExpressMatch (University of Sao Paulo),
the KAIST data set.
In CROHME 2014 a new test set has been created with 987 new expressions and 2 new tasks has been added: isolated symbol recognition and matrix recognition. Train and test files as the evaluation scripts for these new tasks are provided. For the isolated symbol datasets, elements are extracted from full expression using the existing datasets, which also includes segmentation errors. For the matrix recognition task, 380 new expressions have been labelled and split into training and test sets.
Furthermore, 6 participants of the 2012 competition provide their recognized expressions for the 2012 test part. This data allows research on decision fusion or evaluation metrics.
Technical Details
The ink corresponding to each expression is stored in an InkML file. An InkML file mainly contains three kinds of information:
The ink: a set of traces made of points;
The symbol level ground truth: the segmentation and label information of each symbol in the expression;
The expression level ground truth: the MathML structure of the expression.
The two levels of ground truth information (at the symbol as well as at the expression level) are entered manually. Furthermore, some general information is added in the file:
The channels (here, X and Y);
The writer information (identification, handedness (left/right), age, gender, etc.), if available;
The LaTeX ground truth (without any reference to the ink and hence, easy to render);
The unique identification code of the ink (UI), etc.
The InkML format makes references between the digital ink of the expression, its segmentation into symbols and its MathML representation. Thus, the stroke segmentation of a symbol can be linked to its MathML representation.
The recognized expressions are the outputs of the recognition competitors' systems. It uses the same InkML format, but without the ink information (only segmentation, label and MathML structure).
More details available on CROHME website.

The Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English is based on hundreds of recordings of natural speech from all over the United States, representing a wide variety of people of different regional origins, ages, occupations, and ethnic and social backgrounds. It reflects many ways that people use language in their lives: conversation, gossip, arguments, on-the-job talk, card games, city council meetings, sales pitches, classroom lectures, political speeches, bedtime stories, sermons, weddings, and more. The corpus was collected by the University of California, Santa Barbara Center for the Study of Discourse, Director John W. Du Bois (UCSB), Associate Editors: Wallace L. Chafe (UCSB), Charles Meyer (UMass, Boston), and Sandra A. Thompson (UCSB).
Each speech file is accompanied by a transcript in which phrases are time stamped with respect to the audio recording. Personal names, place names, phone numbers, etc., in the transcripts have been altered to preserve the anonymity of the speakers and their acquaintances and the audio files have been filtered to make these portions of the recordings unrecognizable. Pitch information is still recoverable from these filtered portions of the recordings, but the amplitude levels in these regions have been reduced relative to the original signal. The audio data consists of MP3 format speech files, recorded in two-channel pcm, at 22050Hz.

Restaurant inspections ensure that food served to the public at licensed food establishments follows food safety guidelines. The Food Protection Division of the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) is committed to maintaining the safety of food bought, sold, or prepared for public consumption in Chicago by carrying out science-based inspections of all retail food establishments. These inspections promote public health in areas of food safety and sanitation and prevent the occurrence of food-borne illness. CDPH's licensed, accredited sanitarians inspect retail food establishments such as restaurants, grocery stores, bakeries, convenience stores, hospitals, nursing homes, day care facilities, shelters, schools, and temporary food service events. Inspections focus on food handling practices, product temperatures, personal hygiene, facility maintenance, and pest control. All restaurants are subject to certain recurring inspections. Each year a restaurant is subject to annual inspections to ensure continued compliance with City ordinances and regulations. In addition to recurring inspections, restaurants may also be inspected in response to a complaint. Some of these recurring inspections, such as the inspection by the Buildings Department, will be scheduled, while others will not.
Generally inspections are conducted by the Health Department for sanitation and safe food handling practices, the Buildings Department to ensure the safety of the structure, and the Fire Department to ensure safe fire exits.The City's Dumpster Task Force, a collaborative effort between the Health Department and Streets and Sanitation Department, also inspects restaurants to ensure compliance with sanitation regulations.

Originally, images were extracted from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) dataset. The NAIP dataset consists of a total of 330,000 scenes spanning the whole of the Continental United States (CONUS). The authors used the uncompressed digital Ortho quarter quad tiles (DOQQs) which are GeoTIFF images and the area corresponds to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) topographic quadrangles. The average image tiles are ~6000 pixels in width and ~7000 pixels in height, measuring around 200 megabytes each. The entire NAIP dataset for CONUS is ~65 terabytes. The imagery is acquired at a 1-m ground sample distance (GSD) with a horizontal accuracy that lies within six meters of photo-identifiable ground control points.
The images consist of 4 bands - red, green, blue and Near Infrared (NIR). In order to maintain the high variance inherent in the entire NAIP dataset, we sample image patches from a multitude of scenes (a total of 1500 image tiles) covering different landscapes like rural areas, urban areas, densely forested, mountainous terrain, small to large water bodies, agricultural areas, etc. covering the whole state of California. An image labeling tool developed as part of this study was used to manually label uniform image patches belonging to a particular landcover class.
Once labeled, 28x28 non-overlapping sliding window blocks were extracted from the uniform image patch and saved to the dataset with the corresponding label. We chose 28x28 as the window size to maintain a significantly bigger context, and at the same time not to make it as big as to drop the relative statistical properties of the target class conditional distributions within the contextual window. Care was taken to avoid interclass overlaps within a selected and labeled image patch.
Content
Each sample image is 28x28 pixels and consists of 4 bands - red, green, blue and near infrared.
The training and test labels are one-hot encoded 1x6 vectors
The six classes represent the six broad land covers which include barren land, trees, grassland, roads, buildings and water bodies.
Training and test datasets belong to disjoint set of image tiles.
Each image patch is size normalized to 28x28 pixels.
Once generated, both the training and testing datasets were randomized using a pseudo-random number generator.

About fastText
fastText is a library for efficient learning of word representations and sentence classification. One of the key features of fastText word representation is its ability to produce vectors for any words, even made-up ones. Indeed, fastText word vectors are built from vectors of substrings of characters contained in it. This allows you to build vectors even for misspelled words or concatenation of words.
About the vectors
These pre-trained vectors contain 2 million word vectors trained on Common Crawl (600B tokens).
The first line of the file contains the number of words in the vocabulary and the size of the vectors. Each line contains a word followed by its vectors, like in the default fastText text format. Each value is space separated. Words are ordered by descending frequency.

Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition
In this work we investigate the effect of the convolutional network depth on its accuracy in the large-scale image recognition setting. Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.

VGG Architectures
What is a Pre-trained Model?
A pre-trained model has been previously trained on a dataset and contains the weights and biases that represent the features of whichever dataset it was trained on. Learned features are often transferable to different data. For example, a model trained on a large dataset of bird images will contain learned features like edges or horizontal lines that you would be transferable your dataset.
Why use a Pre-trained Model?
Pre-trained models are beneficial to us for many reasons. By using a pre-trained model you are saving time. Someone else has already spent the time and compute resources to learn a lot of features and your model will likely benefit from it."

Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition
Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity.
An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers.
The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.

The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or CITES for short, is an international treaty organization tasked with monitoring, reporting, and providing recommendations on the international species trade. CITES is a division of the IUCN, which is one of the principal international organization focused on wildlife conversation at large. It is not a part of the UN (though its reports are read closely by the UN).
CITES is one of the oldest conservation organizations in existence. Participation in CITES is voluntary, but almost every member nation in the UN (and, therefore, almost every country worldwide) participates. Countries participating in CITES are obligated to report on roughly 5000 animal species and 29000 plant species brought into or exported out of their countries, and to honor limitations placed on the international trade of these species.
Protected species are organized into three appendixes. Appendix I species are those whose trade threatens them with extinction. Two particularly famous examples of Class I species are the black rhinoceros and the African elephant, whose extremely valuable tusks are an alluring target for poachers exporting ivory abroad. There are 1200 such species. Appendix II species are those not threatened with extinction, but whose trade is nevertheless detrimental. Most species in cites, around 21000 of them, are in Appendix II. Finally, Appendix III animals are those submitted to CITES by member states as a control mechanism. There are about 170 such species, and their export or import requires permits from the submitting member state(s).
This dataset records all legal species imports and exports carried out in 2016 (and a few records from 2017) and reported to CITES. Species not on the CITES lists are not included; nor is the significant, and highly illegal, ongoing black market trading activity.
Content
This dataset contains records on every international import or export conducted with species from the CITES lists in 2016. It contains columns identifying the species, the import and export countries, and the amount and characteristics of the goods being traded (which range from live animals to skins and cadavers).
For further details on individual rows and columns refer to the metadata on the /data tab. A much more detailed description of each of the fields is available in the original CITES documentation.
Acknowledgements
This dataset was originally aggregated by CITES and made available online through this downloader tool. The CITES downloader goes back to 1975, however it is only possible to download fully international data two years at a time (or so) due to limitations in the number of rows allowed by the data exporter. If you would like data going further back, check out the downloader. Be warned, though, this data takes a long time to generate!
This data is prepared for CITES by UNEP, a division of the UN, and hence likely covered by the UN Data License.

The database contains wav recordings from the same optical sensor inserted in-turn into six insectary boxes containing only one mosquito species of both sexes. As the mosquitoes fly randomly through the sensor their wingbeat partially occludes the light from the transmitter to the receiver. The light fluctuation recorded follows the rhythm of the wingbeat. Insect Biometrics, in the context of our work, is a measurable behavioral characteristic of flying insects. Biometric identifiers are related to the shape of the body (main body size, wing shape, wingbeat frequency, pattern movement of the wings). Biometric identification methods use biometric characteristics or traits to verify species/sex identities when insects access endpoint traps following a bait.

Inspiration
The point of having such recordings is to eventually embed optoelectronic sensors in automatic traps that will report counts, species and sex identity of captured mosquitoes. All species of this dataset can be dangerous as they are potential vectors of pathogens that cause serious illnesses. A widespread network of traps for insects of economic importance such as fruit flies and of hygienic importance such as mosquitoes allows the automatic creation of spatiotemporal maps and cuts down significantly the manual cost of visiting the traps. The creation of historical data can lead to the prediction of outbreaks and risk assessment in general.
We provide code to read the data and extract the power spectral density signature of each wingbeat. We also extract Mel-scaled, filter-bank features. How about wavelets and time-varying autoregressive models? The starter code using top-tier shallow classifiers achieves a mean accuracy of 81-84%. Deep-learning performs better. Can you classify genus, perform clustering, apply transfer learning to spectral data?

It was released in May 2016 for Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Overwatch assigns players into two teams of six, with each player selecting from a roster of over 20 characters, known in-game as ""heroes"", each with a unique style of play, whose roles are divided into four general categories: Offense, Defense, Tank, and Support. Players on a team work together to secure and defend control points on a map or escort a payload across the map in a limited amount of time.

This dataset focuses on public assistance in the United States with initial coverage of the WIC Program. The program is formally known as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). The program allocates Federal and State funds to help low-income women and children up to age five who are at nutritional risk. Funds are used to provide supplemental foods, baby formula, health care, and nutrition education.
Content
Files include participation data and spending for state WIC programs, and poverty data for each state. Data is for fiscal years 2013-2016, which is actually October 2012 through September 2016.
Motivation
My original purpose here is two-fold:
Explore various aspects of US Public Assistance. Show trends over recent years and better understand differences across state agencies. Although the federal government sponsors the program and provides funding, program are administered at the state level and can widely vary. Indian nations (native Americans) also administer their own programs.
Share with the Kaggle Community the joy - and pain - of working with government data. Data is often spread across numerous agency sites and comes in a variety of formats. Often the data is provided in Excel, with the files consisting of multiple tabs. Also, files are formatted as reports and contain aggregated data (sums, averages, etc.) along with base data.
Additional Content Ideas
The dataset can benefit greatly from additional content. Economics, additional demographics, administrative costs and more. I'd like to eventually explore the money trail from taxes and corporate subsidies, through the government agencies, and on to program participants. All community ideas are welcome!"

freeCodeCamp is a web-based non-profit organization and learning platform which teaches programming newcomers how to code. It was founded by Quincy Larson in 2014, who in a 2015 interview stated that ""freeCodeCamp is my effort to correct the extremely inefficient and circuitous way I learned to code...all those things that made learning to code a nightmare to me are things that we are trying to fix with freeCodeCamp."" The original curriculum took approximately 800 hours to complete; today, after several refreshes and additions, there is over 2000 hours of learner's content on the site.
freeCodeCamp also provides several helpful secondary resources for learners. One of them is a freeCodeCamp Gitter chatroom. Gitter is an open-source instant messaging service that lets users share thoughts and ideas with one another. This dataset is a record of activity from this /freeCodeCamp Gitter chatroom, containing posts from students, bots, moderators, and contributors between December 31, 2014 and December 9, 2017.
Content
The data includes the usernames, screen names, timestamps, post content, and metadata of every post made to /freeCodeCamp in the aforementioned three year period. This comes out to nearly 5 million records overall.
The data comes in the form of a set of three JSON files, each named freecodecamp_casual_chatroom_[01/02/03].json. The three files make a continuous dataset containing all posts sent during the aforementioned period, but note that they overlap in a few days. The three files were extracted on 01-06-2016, 09-03-2017, and 12-12-2017, respectively. The included convert.py file was used to concatenate these files into a unified CSV file, freecodecamp_casual_chatroom.csv.
Some preliminary analyses using this dataset can be found at the Github repository for the freeCodeCamp's Open Data Initiative. For more details on specific elements of the dataset refer to the column metadata tab, or to the detailed documentation provided in the Gitter API Documentation.
Acknowledgements
The datasets are a contribution from freeCodeCamp as part of the freeCodeCamp's Open Data Initiative. More information about the rationale of this initiative can be found on this Medium article.
This dataset was extracted using Python code over the Gitter API. All the files were prepared by Evaristo Caraballo (GitHub: @evaristoc).
Records are not anonymised or modified and are presented ""as they are"".
Thanks to freeCodeCamp team, specially to Quincy Larson for supporting the initiative. Thanks to all freeCodeCamp students who kindly allowed to share their personal progress and to Gitter for making these data available.
If you have questions about this dataset, please contact quincy@freecodecamp.com or get in touch with us through https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience (Gitter registration might be required).

This dataset presents three years of developer chat about web technologies. Can you use it to trace the rise and fall over certain technologies, like Angular and React, over time?
What do programming newcomers tend to get stuck on the most? Are there any canned responses that are particularly common in the freeCodeCamp chatroom?
What other interesting insights into programmer culture can you glean from examining this dataset?"

This is a protein data set retrieved from RCS PDB.
The PDB archive is a repository of atomic coordinates and other information describing proteins and other important biological macromolecules. Structural biologists use methods such as X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and cryo-electron microscopy to determine the location of each atom relative to each other in the molecule. They then deposit this information, which is then annotated and publicly released into the archive by the wwPDB.
The constantly-growing PDB is a reflection of the research that is happening in laboratories across the world. This can make it both exciting and challenging to use the database in research and education. Structures are available for many of the proteins and nucleic acids involved in the central processes of life, so you can go to the PDB archive to find structures for ribosomes, oncogenes, drug targets, and even whole viruses. However, it can be a challenge to find the information that you need, since the PDB archives so many different structures. You will often find multiple structures for a given molecule, or partial structures, or structures that have been modified or inactivated from their native form.

It is not always easy to find databases from real world manufacturing plants, specially mining plants. So, I would like to share this database with the community, which comes from one of the most important parts of a mining process: a flotation plant!
The main goal is to use this data to predict how much impurity is in the ore concentrate. As this impurity is measured every hour, if we can predict how much silica (impurity) is in the ore concentrate, we can help the engineers, giving them early information to take actions (empowering!). Hence, they will be able to take corrective actions in advance (reduce impurity, if it is the case) and also help the environment (reducing the amount of ore that goes to tailings as you reduce silica in the ore concentrate).
Content
The first column shows time and date range (from march of 2017 until september of 2017). Some columns were sampled every 20 second. Others were sampled on a hourly base.
The second and third columns are quality measures of the iron ore pulp right before it is fed into the flotation plant. Column 4 until column 8 are the most important variables that impact in the ore quality in the end of the process. From column 9 until column 22, we can see process data (level and air flow inside the flotation columns, which also impact in ore quality. The last two columns are the final iron ore pulp quality measurement from the lab. Target is to predict the last column, which is the % of silica in the iron ore concentrate.
Inspiration
I have been working in this dataset for at least six months and would like to see if the community can help to answer the following questions:
Is it possible to predict % Silica Concentrate every minute?
How many steps (hours) ahead can we predict % Silica in Concentrate? This would help engineers to act in predictive and optimized way, mitigatin the % of iron that could have gone to tailings.
Is it possible to predict % Silica in Concentrate whitout using % Iron Concentrate column (as they are highly correlated)?"

I have made the database of photos sorted by products and brands. Screenshots were performed only on official brand websites.
Content
The main dataset (style.zip) is 894 color images (150x150x3) with 7 brands and 10 products, and the file with labels style.csv. Photo files are in the .png format and the labels are integers and values.
The file StyleColorImages.h5 consists of preprocessing images of this set: image tensors and targets (labels).
Acknowledgements
I have published the data for absolutely free using by any site visitor. But this database contains the names of famous brands, so it can not be used for commercial purposes.
Usage
Classification, image recognition and colorizing, etc. in a case of a small number of images are useful exercises. The main question we can try to answer with the help of the data is whether the algorithms can recognize the unique design style well enough. To facilitate the task, I chose the most easily recognizable brands with a bright style.

Kernels from Porto Seguro. Some are more overfit than others.
Content
Copied by hand from Kaggle. (May contain errors, obviously.) Each kernel is identified by a link to the most recent version that has a verified score matching what is in the Kernels tab. (Notebooks are linked to the Code tab, since that's where the scores are.) In many cases this is the most recent version, so if the kernel is subsequently revised, the link may be wrong (since it will then point to the subsequent most recent version, which may not be scored, or its score may not match the Kernels tab). Most of the fields should be self-explanatory, except ""adjusted"", which adjusts the public-private difference by subtracting the median difference over the whole leaderboard. (Private scores are typically higher, presumably because the cases in private portion of the test data were easier to predict, so an ""adjusted"" value of zero represents a kernel that wouldn't have gained or lost much in the shake-up.)
Acknowledgements
I would like to thank Kaggle, Porto Seguro, and the authors of the kernels.

What factors might help predict how much better or worse a kernel will do on the private leaderboard than on the public? It's one competition: just a start, but you've got to start somewhere."

Well, at least some of us were, by the draw, here comes the data. History of all previous matches, scores and titles of all participating teams to help us predict who will qualify and may even predict who will win. So, lets get our algorithms going.
Content: The dataset contains 32 entries(of the 32 participating teams of course), each team will have 3 matches in the group stage, so each match is mentioned vs whom, the history between those 2 teams with wins minus losses, let's say Brazil has beaten Argentina 14 times, Argentina won 12 and there were 3 draws, so that will be +2 for brazil and -2 for Argentina, the same goes for goals scored. You will find some entries with N/A and some with zeros, so what is the difference? The zeros mean that the 2 teams evened out, while N/As means that they have no previous history together and they have never faced each other. So, no data available. The matches history is up to 2012-2014. So, there is a couple of years missing here, and the FIFA rank is up to date, which will be updated every month till we get there.

NLP is a hot topic currently! Team AI really want's to leverage the NLP research and this an attempt for all the NLP researchers to explore exciting insights from bilingual data
The Japanese-English Bilingual Corpus of Wikipedia's Kyoto Articles‚Äù aims mainly at supporting research and development relevant to high-performance multilingual machine translation, information extraction, and other language processing technologies.
Unique Features
A precise and large-scale corpus containing about 500,000 pairs of manually-translated sentences. Can be exploited for research and development of high-performance multilingual machine translation, information extraction, and so on.
The three-step translation process (primary translation -> secondary translation to improve fluency -> final check for technical terms) has been clearly recorded. Enables observation of how translations have been elaborated so it can be applied for uses such as research and development relevant to translation aids and error analysis of human translation.
Translated articles concern Kyoto and other topics such as traditional Japanese culture, religion, and history. Can also be utilized for tourist information translation or to create glossaries for travel guides.
The Japanese-English Bilingual Kyoto Lexicon is also available. This lexicon was created by extracting the Japanese-English word pairs from this corpus.
Sample
One Wikipedia article is stored as one XML file in this corpus, and the corpus contains 14,111 files in total.
The following is a short quotation from a corpus file titled ‚ÄúRyoan-ji Temple‚Äù. Each tag has different implications. For example:
<j>Original Japanese sentence<j> <e type=""trans"" ver=""1"">Primary translation</e> <e type=""trans"" ver=""2"">Secondary translation</e> <e type=""check"" ver=""1"">Final translation</e> <cmt>Comment added by translators</cmt>
Categories
The files have been divided into 15 categories: school, railway, family, building, Shinto, person name, geographical name, culture, road, Buddhism, literature, title, history, shrines and temples, and emperor (Click the link to view a sample file for each category).

Nearest neighbors The Euclidean distance (or cosine similarity) between two word vectors provides an effective method for measuring the linguistic or semantic similarity of the corresponding words. Sometimes, the nearest neighbors according to this metric reveal rare but relevant words that lie outside an average human's vocabulary.
Linear substructures The similarity metrics used for nearest neighbor evaluations produce a single scalar that quantifies the relatedness of two words. This simplicity can be problematic since two given words almost always exhibit more intricate relationships than can be captured by a single number. For example, man may be regarded as similar to woman in that both words describe human beings; on the other hand, the two words are often considered opposites since they highlight a primary axis along which humans differ from one another.
In order to capture in a quantitative way the nuance necessary to distinguish man from woman, it is necessary for a model to associate more than a single number to the word pair. A natural and simple candidate for an enlarged set of discriminative numbers is the vector difference between the two word vectors. GloVe is designed in order that such vector differences capture as much as possible the meaning specified by the juxtaposition of two words.

Presenting a compendium of crowdsourced journalism from the psuedo-news site The Examiner.
This dataset contains the headlines of 3 million articles written by 21000+ authors over 6 years.
While The Examiner was never praised for its quality, it consistently churned out 1000s of articles per day over several years.
At their height in 2011, The Examiner was ranked highly in google search and had enormous shares on social media. At one point it was the 10th largest site on mobile and was attracting 20 M unique visitors a month.
As a platform driven towards advert revenue, most of their content was rushed, unsourced and factually sparse. It still manages to capture in great detail, the trending topics over a long period of time.

internet",Other,51 MB,Other,"2,116 views",111 downloads,,3 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/diplomacy-betrayal-dataset,"This dataset contains a collection of interaction sequences between allies in online Diplomacy [1] games. A sequence consists of consecutive game seasons during which the two players exchange messages and help each other in the game. Half of the sequences end with betrayal, while the other half are part of lasting friendships.
Description
Diplomacy [1] is a popular and engaging strategic board game that is often played online [2, 3]. It is based heavily on communication between the players. Due to its military domination setting, Diplomacy is a well suited environment for studying naturally occurring betrayal and deception.
From a collection of Diplomacy game logs, we identified and extracted ongoing, established, and reciprocal friendships: relationships that contain at least two consecutive and reciprocated acts of support that span at least three seasons in game time, with no more than five seasons passing between two acts of friendship.
We then identified 250 betrayals: the subset of friendships described above that are followed by at least two attacks. To match each betrayal, we selected a friendship that is not followed by any offensive action, but is otherwise nearly identical (in terms of length and relative time within the game). The current dataset consists of these selected betrayals and friendships only.
Each relationship contains a sequence of seasons. Within each season, we provide features extracted from the messages sent by each player.

Data format
The dataset is a UTF-8 encoded JSON file, which can be loaded into a Python kernel with the following code:
>>> import json
>>> from io import open
>>> with open(""diplomacy_data.json"", ""r"") as f:
...     diplomacy = json.load(f)
...
It is structured as a list of dictionaries, one for each of the 500 sequences.
>>> len(diplomacy)
500
This is an example of one such entry, with the fields explained:
>>> entry = diplomacy[0]
>>> entry
{
    'idx': 0,           # unique identifier of the dataset entry
    'game': 74,         # unique identifier of the game it comes from
    'betrayal': True,   # whether the friendship ended in betrayal
    'people': u'AT',    # the countries represented by the two players
                        # (in this case, Austria and Turkey)
    'seasons': ...
}
The 'seasons' field is again a list of dictionaries, one for each game season in the friendship sequence. In the example below, there are 8 seasons, each identified by the game year. Decimal notation is used to denote the season in each year. For example, 1906.0 is the spring of 1906 and 1906.5 is the fall of 1906. Each season is also marked with what interaction the two players have at the end of the discussion: whether the players supported one another ('support'), attacked one another ('attack'), or did not have explicit military interactions (null).
>>> seasons = entry['seasons']
>>> len(seasons)
8
>>> seasons[0]
{
    'season': 1906.5,           # fall of the year 1906 (game time)
    'interaction': {
        'victim': u'support',   # the victim supported the betrayer
        'betrayer': u'support'  # the betrayer supported the victim
    },
    'messages': {
        'victim': ...,
        'betrayer': ...
    }
}
The ['messages']['victim'] and ['messages']['betrayer'] fields are lists of features of each message sent by the victim to the betrayer, and by the betrayer to the victim, respectively:
>>> msgs = seasons[0]['messages']['betrayer']
>>> len(msgs)
6
>>> msgs[0]
{
    ""n_words"": 146,             # number of words in the message

    },                          # (using Stanford Sentiment Analysis [5])

    ""lexicon_words"": {          # words and phrases matching several
        ""disc_expansion"": [     # linguistic and psycholinguistic lexicons
            ""until"",            # (see below for details)
            ""yet"",
            ""instead""
        ],
        ""premise"": [
            ""for"",
            ""for""
        ],
        ...
    },
    ""frequent_words"": [         # frequent words in the message
        ""more"",                 # (occurring in at least 50 messages
        ""let"",                  # and 5 friendships overall)
        ""keep"",
        ""...
    ]
}
The words in each list are in random order. The order of messages within a season is also randomized. This measure is in place to protect the privacy of the players and of their conversations.
The lexicons used to construct the ""lexicon_words"" field are:
'claim', 'premise': Argumentation structure markers [6]
'allsubj': Subjective markers [7]
'disc_*': Discourse markers from the Penn Discourse Treebank. [8] Includes 'disc_comparison', 'disc_expansion', 'disc_contingency', 'disc_temporal_future' and 'disc_temporal_rest' (we manually split 'temporal' from PDT into 'temporal_future' and 'temporal_rest' to capture planning).

‚ÄúA blog (a truncation of the expression ""weblog"") is a discussion or informational website published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (""posts""). Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order, so that the most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page. Until 2009, blogs were usually the work of a single individual, occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single subject or topic.‚Äù -- Wikipedia article ‚ÄúBlog‚Äù
This dataset contains text from blogs written on or before 2004, with each blog being the work of a single user.
Content:
The Blog Authorship Corpus consists of the collected posts of 19,320 bloggers gathered from blogger.com in August 2004. The corpus incorporates a total of 681,288 posts and over 140 million words - or approximately 35 posts and 7250 words per person.
Each blog is presented as a separate file, the name of which indicates a blogger id# and the blogger‚Äôs self-provided gender, age, industry and astrological sign. (All are labeled for gender and age but for many, industry and/or sign is marked as unknown.)
All bloggers included in the corpus fall into one of three age groups: * 8240 ""10s"" blogs (ages 13-17), * 8086 ""20s"" blogs(ages 23-27) * 2994 ""30s"" blogs (ages 33-47).
For each age group there are an equal number of male and female bloggers.
Each blog in the corpus includes at least 200 occurrences of common English words. All formatting has been stripped with two exceptions. Individual posts within a single blogger are separated by the date of the following post and links within a post are denoted by the label urllink.

This first public dataset was created to investigate the use of machine learning to predict the stability of a grasp. Due to the limitations of the current simulation, it is a restricted dataset - only grasping a ball. The dataset is annotated with an objective grasp quality and contains the different data gathered from the joints (position, velocity, effort).

Sensor readings from a wall-following robot,Data collected from a robot while navigating around a room,UCI Machine Learning,10,"Version 1,2017-09-06",robotics,CSV,1 MB,Other,"1,859 views",157 downloads,2 kernels,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/wall-following-robot,"Context
The data were collected as the SCITOS G5 navigated through the room following the wall in a clockwise direction, for 4 rounds. To navigate, the robot uses 24 ultrasound sensors arranged circularly around its ""waist"". The numbering of the ultrasound sensors starts at the front of the robot and increases in clockwise direction.
The provided files comprise three diferent data sets.
The first one contains the raw values of the measurements of all 24 ultrasound sensors and the corresponding class label (Moving forward, turning left, etc). Sensor readings are sampled at a rate of 9 samples per second.
The second one contains four sensor readings named 'simplified distances' and the corresponding class label l (Moving forward, turning left, etc). These simplified distances are referred to as the 'front distance', 'left distance', 'right distance' and 'back distance'. They consist, respectively, of the minimum sensor readings among those within 60 degree arcs located at the front, left, right and back parts of the robot.
The third one contains only the front and left simplified distances and the corresponding class labell (Moving forward, turning left, etc).
It is worth mentioning that the 24 ultrasound readings and the simplified distances were collected at the same time step, so each file has the same number of rows (one for each sampling time step).
The wall-following task and data gathering were designed to test the hypothesis that this apparently simple navigation task is indeed a non-linearly separable classification task. Thus, linear classifiers, such as the Perceptron network, are not able to learn the task and command the robot around the room without collisions. Nonlinear neural classifiers, such as the MLP network, are able to learn the task and command the robot successfully without collisions.
If some kind of short-term memory mechanism is provided to the neural classifiers, their performances are improved in general. For example, if past inputs are provided together with current sensor readings, even the Perceptron becomes able to learn the task and command the robot successfully. If a recurrent neural network, such as the Elman network, is used to learn the task, the resulting dynamical classifier is able to learn the task using less hidden neurons than the MLP network.
Files with different number of sensor readings were built in order to evaluate the performance of the classifiers with respect to the number of inputs.

The drug-development process is time-consuming and expensive. In High-Throughput Screening (HTS), batches of compounds are tested against a biological target to test the compound's ability to bind to the target. Targets might be antibodies for example. If the compound binds to the target then it is active for that target and known as a hit.
Virtual screening is the computational or in silico screening of biological compounds and complements the HTS process. It is used to aid the selection of compounds for screening in HTS bioassays or for inclusion in a compound-screening library.
Drug discovery is the first stage of the drug-development process and involves finding compounds to test and screen against biological targets. This first stage is known as primary-screening and usually involves the screening of thousands of compounds.
This dataset is a collection of 21 bioassays (screens) that measure the activity of various compounds against different biological targets.
Content
Each bioassay is split into test and train files.
Here are some descriptions of some of the assays compounds. The source, unfortunately, does not have descriptions for every assay. That's the nature of the beast for finding this kind data and was also pointed out in the original study.
Primary screens
AID362 details the results of a primary screening bioassay for Formylpeptide Receptor Ligand Binding University from the New Mexico Center for Molecular Discovery. It is a relatively small dataset with 4279 compounds and with a ratio of 1 active to 70 inactive compounds (1.4% minority class). The compounds were selected on the basis of preliminary virtual screening of approximately 480,000 drug-like small molecules from Chemical Diversity Laboratories.

NLP is a hot topic currently! Team AI really want's to leverage the NLP research and this an attempt for all the NLP researchers to explore exciting insights from bilingual data
The Japanese-English Bilingual Corpus of Wikipedia's Kyoto Articles‚Äù aims mainly at supporting research and development relevant to high-performance multilingual machine translation, information extraction, and other language processing technologies.
Unique Features
A precise and large-scale corpus containing about 500,000 pairs of manually-translated sentences. Can be exploited for research and development of high-performance multilingual machine translation, information extraction, and so on.
The three-step translation process (primary translation -> secondary translation to improve fluency -> final check for technical terms) has been clearly recorded. Enables observation of how translations have been elaborated so it can be applied for uses such as research and development relevant to translation aids and error analysis of human translation.
Translated articles concern Kyoto and other topics such as traditional Japanese culture, religion, and history. Can also be utilized for tourist information translation or to create glossaries for travel guides.
The Japanese-English Bilingual Kyoto Lexicon is also available. This lexicon was created by extracting the Japanese-English word pairs from this corpus.
Sample
One Wikipedia article is stored as one XML file in this corpus, and the corpus contains 14,111 files in total.
The following is a short quotation from a corpus file titled ‚ÄúRyoan-ji Temple‚Äù. Each tag has different implications. For example:
<j>Original Japanese sentence<j> <e type=""trans"" ver=""1"">Primary translation</e> <e type=""trans"" ver=""2"">Secondary translation</e> <e type=""check"" ver=""1"">Final translation</e> <cmt>Comment added by translators</cmt>
Categories
The files have been divided into 15 categories: school, railway, family, building, Shinto, person name, geographical name, culture, road, Buddhism, literature, title, history, shrines and temples, and emperor (Click the link to view a sample file for each category).

Spelling Corrector,Datasets from Peter Norvig's classic spelling corrector in half a page of Python,Adam Mathias Bittlingmayer,10,"Version 2,2017-05-25|Version 1,2017-05-25","languages

One week in 2007, two friends (Dean and Bill) independently told me they were amazed at Google's spelling correction. Type in a search like [speling] and Google instantly comes back with Showing results for: spelling. I thought Dean and Bill, being highly accomplished engineers and mathematicians, would have good intuitions about how this process works. But they didn't, and come to think of it, why should they know about something so far outside their specialty?
I figured they, and others, could benefit from an explanation. The full details of an industrial-strength spell corrector are quite complex (you can read a little about it here or here). But I figured that in the course of a transcontinental plane ride I could write and explain a toy spelling corrector that achieves 80 or 90% accuracy at a processing speed of at least 10 words per second in about half a page of code.
A Kernel has been added with Peter's basic spell.py and evaluation code to set a baseline. Minimal modifications were made so that it runs on this environment.
Data files
big.txt is required by the code. That's how it learns the probabilities of English words. You can prepend more text data to it, but be sure to leave in the little Python snippet at the end.
Testing files
The other files are for testing the accuracy. The baseline code should get 75% of 270 correct on spell-testset1.txt, and 68% of 400 correct on spell-testset2.txt.
I've also added some other files for more extensive testing. The example Kernel runs all of them but birkbeck.txt by default. Here's the output:
Testing spell-testset1.txt
75% of 270 correct (6% unknown) at 32 words per second 
Testing spell-testset2.txt
68% of 400 correct (11% unknown) at 28 words per second 
Testing wikipedia.txt
61% of 2455 correct (24% unknown) at 21 words per second 
Testing aspell.txt
43% of 531 correct (23% unknown) at 15 words per second 
The larger datasets take a few minutes to run. birkbeck.txt takes more than a few minutes.
You can try adding other datasets, or splitting these ones in meaningful ways - for example a dataset of only words of 5 characters or less, or 10 characters or more, or without uppercase - to understand the effect of changes you make on different types of words.
Languages
The data and testing files include English only for now. In principle it is easily generalisable to other languages."

space",CSV,2 MB,Other,"1,836 views",131 downloads,2 kernels,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/combo17-galaxy-dataset,"This dataset was obtained here and their description is reproduced below.
Astronomical background
Galaxies are fundamental structures in the Universe. Our Sun lives in the Milky Way Galaxy we can see as a patchy band of light across the sky. The components of a typical galaxy are: a vast number of stars (total mass ~106-1011 Mo where Mo is the unit of a solar mass), a complex interstellar medium of gas and dust from which stars form (typically 1-100% of the stellar component mass), a single supermassive black hole at the center (typically <1% of the stellar component mass), and a poorly understood component called Dark Matter with mass ~5-10-times all the other components combined.
Over the ~14 billion years since the Big Bang, the rate at which galaxies convert interstellar matter into stars has not been constant, and thus the brightness and color of galaxies change with cosmic time. This phenomenon has several names in the astronomical community: the history of star formation in the Universe, chemical evolution of galaxies, or simply galaxy evolution. A major effort over several decades has been made to quantify and understand galaxy evolution using telescopes at all wavelengths.
The traditional tool for such studies has been optical spectroscopy which easily reveals signatures of star formation in nearby galaxies. However, to study star formation in the galaxies recently emerged after the Big Bang, we must examine extremely faint galaxies which are too faint for spectroscopy, even using the biggest available telescopes. A feasible alternative is to obtain images of faint galaxies at random locations in the sky in narrow spectral bands, and thereby construct crude spectra. First, statistical analysis of such multiband photometric datasets are used to classify galaxies, stars and quasars. Second, for the galaxies, multivariate regression is made to develop photometric estimates of redshift, which is a measure both of distance from us and age since the Big Bang. Third, one can examine galaxy colors as a function of redshift (after various corrections are made) to study the evolution of star formation. The present dataset is taken after these first two steps are complete.
Contents
Wolf et al. (2004) provide the first public catalog of a large dataset (63,501 objects) with brightness measurements in 17 bands in the visible band. (Note that the Sloan Digital Sky Survey provides a much larger dataset of 108 objects with measurements in 5 bands.) We provide here a subset of their catalog with 65 columns of information on 3,462 galaxies. These are objects in the Chandra Deep Field South field which Wolf and colleagues have classified as `Galaxies'. The column headings are formally described in their Table 3, and the columns we provide are summarized here with brief commentary:
Col 1: Nr, object number
Col 2-3: Total R (red band) magnitude and its error. This was the band at which the basic catalog was constructed. Magnitudes are inverted logarithmic measures of brightness. A galaxy with R=21 is 100-times brighter than one with R=26. The error is the standard deviation derived from detailed knowledge of the measurement process. This dataset is an excellent example of astronomical datasets where each variable is accompanied by heteroscedastic measurement errors of known variances.
Col 4-5: ApDRmag is the difference between the total and aperture magnitude in the R band. This is a rough measure of the size of the galaxy in the image where ApDRmag=0 corresponds to a point source. Negative values are not physically meaningful. mu_max is the central surface brightness of the object in the R band. The difference between Rmag and mu_max should also be an indicator of galaxy size.
Col 6-9: Mcz and MCzml are two redshift estimates. Mcz is the preferred value. e.Mcz is its estimated error, and chi2red is the reduced chi-squared value of the least-squares fit of the 17-band magnitudes to the best-fit template galaxy spectrum. Galaxies with large e.Mcz or chi2red might be omitted as unreliable.
Col 10-29: These give the absolute magnitudes (i.e. intrinsic luminosities) of the galaxy in 10 bands, with their measurement errors. They are based on the measured magnitudes and the redshifts, and represent the intrinsic luminosities of the galaxies; a galaxy with M=-15 is 100-times less luminous than one with M=-20. These magnitudes are not all independent of each others, but the are important for representing intrinsic properties of the galaxies. Below is one of several redshift-stratified plots of the B-band absolute magnitude (abscissa) against the difference of magnitude (i.e. ratio of luminosities) between the 2800A ultraviolet and blue band, which is a sensitive indicator of star formation. A redshift-dependent bimodal distribution is seen.
Col 30-55: Observed brightnesses in 13 bands in sequence from 420 nm in the ultraviolet to 915 nm in the far red. These are given in linear variables with units of photon flux densities, photons/m2/s/nm. Again, each measurement is accompanied by a measurement error which can be used to distinguish measurement from intrinsic dispersions in the distributions.
Col 56-65: Observed brightnesses in 5 traditional broad spectral bands, UBVRI. These are largely redundant with the 13 bands in the previous columns.
Statistical exercises
Examine basic characteristics of the survey which are not of scientific interest. These include the absence of high-redshift (i.e. distant) high-absolute-magnitude (i.e. faint) galaxies; the dropoff in flux with redshift; the dropoff in image size with redshift.
Study these two populations as a function of redshift to investigate the evolution of star formation."

While scrapping this info, I learned quite a lot in R programming, system speed, memory usage etc. and developed my niche in Web Scrapping. It took about 4-5 hrs for scrapping this data through my system (4GB RAM) and nearly about 4-5 days working out my idea through this project.
Content
The dataset contains Top 50 ranked sites from each 191 countries along with their traffic (global) rank. Here, country_rank represent the traffic rank of that site within the country, and traffic_rank represent the global traffic rank of that site.
Since most of the columns meaning can be derived from their name itself, its pretty much straight forward to understand this dataset. However, there are some instances of confusion which I would like to explain in here:
1) most of the numeric values are in character format, hence, contain spaces which you might need to clean on.
2) There are multiple instances of same website. for.e.g. Yahoo. com is present in 179 rows within this dataset. This is due to their different country rank in each country.
3)The information provided in this dataset is for the top 50 websites in 191 countries as on 25th May 2017 and is subjected to change in future time due to the dynamic structure of ranking.
4) The dataset inactual contains 9540 rows instead of 9550(50*191 rows). This was due to the unavailability of information for 10 websites.
PS: in case if there are anymore queries, comment on this, I'll add an answer to that in above list.

I wouldn't have done this without the help of others. I've scrapped this information from publicly available (open to all) websites namely: 1) http://data.danetsoft.com/ 2) http://www.alexa.com/topsites , of which i'm highly grateful. I truly appreciate and thanks the owner of these sites for providing us with the information that I included today in this dataset.
Inspiration
I feel that there this a lot of scope for exploring & visualization this dataset to find out the trends in the attributes of these websites across countries. Also, one could try predicting the traffic(global) rank being a dependent factor on the other attributes of the website. In any case, this dataset will help you find out the popular sites in your area."

Chronic KIdney Disease dataset,Data has 25 feattures which may predict a patient with chronic kidney disease,Mansoor Iqbal,10,"Version 1,2017-04-13",,CSV,47 KB,Other,"4,068 views",508 downloads,3 kernels,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/mansoordaku/ckdisease,"# Context
First, I am new to ML, and just in case I slip up, apologies in advance!! So, I am doing an online ML course and this is an assignment where we are supposed to practice scikit-learn's PCA routine. Since the course has been ARCHIVED - which means the discussion posts are not answered!! - hence my posting of the problem here.
What better way to learn than to get so many experts giving me feedback ... right?
# Content
The data was taken over a 2-month period in India with 25 features ( eg, red blood cell count, white blood cell count, etc). The target is the 'classification', which is either 'ckd' or 'notckd' - ckd=chronic kidney disease. There are 400 rows
The data needs cleaning: in that it has NaNs and the numeric features need to be forced to floats. Basically, we were instructed to get rid of ALL ROWS with Nans, with no threshold - meaning, any row that has even one NaN, gets deleted.
Part 1: We are asked to choose 3 features (bgr, rc, wc), visualize them, then run the PCA with n_components=2. the PCA is to be run twice: one with no scaling and the second run WITH scaling. And this is where my issue starts ... in that after scaling I can hardly see any difference!
I will stop here for now till I get feedback and then move to Part 2.

The ExtraSensory Dataset,Behavioral Context Recognition In-the-Wild,Yonatan Vaizman,10,"Version 1,2017-06-07",psychology,CSV,24 MB,CC4,"2,840 views",211 downloads,3 kernels,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/yvaizman/the-extrasensory-dataset,"Context
Behavioral Context refers to a wide range of attributes describing what is going on with you: where you are (home, school, work, at the beach, at a restaurant), what you are doing (sleeping, eating, in a meeting, computer work, exercising, shower), who you are with (family, friends, co-workers), your body posture state (sitting, standing, walking, running), and so on. The ability to automatically (effortlessly, frequently, objectively) recognize behavioral context can serve many domains. Medical applications can monitor physical activity or eating habits; aging-at-home programs can log older adults' physical, social, and mental behavior; personal assistant systems can better server the user if they are aware of the context. In-the-wild (in real life), natural behavior is complex, composed of different aspects, and has high variability. You can run outside at the beach, with friends with your phone in the pocket; you can also run indoors, at the gym, on a treadmill, with your phone motionless next to you. This high variability makes context-recognition a hard task to perform in-the-wild.
Content
The ExtraSensory Dataset was collected from 60 participants where each person participated approximately 7 days. We installed our data-collection mobile app on their personal phone and it was used to collect both sensor-measurements and context-labels. The sensor-measurements were recorded automatically for a window of 20-seconds every minute. This included accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, audio, location, and phone-state from the person's phone, as well as accelerometer and compass from an additional smartwatch that we provided. In addition, the app's interface had many mechanisms for self-reporting the relevant context-labels, including reporting past context, near future, responding to notifications, and more. The flexible interface allowed to collect many labels with minimal effort and interaction-time, to avoid interfering with the natural behavior. The data was collected in-the-wild: participants used their phone in any way that was convenient to them, they engaged in their regular behavior and reported an combinations of labels that fit their context.
For every participant (or ""user""), the dataset has a CSV file with pre-computed features that we extracted from the sensors and with labels. Each row has a separate example (representing 1 minute) and is indexed by the timestamp (seconds since the epoch). There are columns for the sensor-features, with the prefix of the column name indicating the sensor it came from (e.g. prefix ""raw_acc:"" indicating a feature came from the raw phone accelerometer measurements). There are columns for 51 diverse context-labels and the value for an example-label pair is either 1 (the label is relevant for the example), 0 (the label is not relevant), or 'NaN' (missing information).
Here, we provide data for 2 of the 60 participants. You can use this partial data to get familiar with the data and practice algorithms. The full dataset is publicly available at http://extrasensory.ucsd.edu. The website has additional parts of the data (such as a wider range of the original reported labels, location coordinates, mood labels from part of the participants). If you use the data for your publications, you are required to cite our original paper Vaizman, Y., Ellis, K., and Lanckriet, G.

Wage Estimates,Modeled wage estimates of average hourly wages,US Bureau of Labor Statistics,10,"Version 1,2017-06-30",income,CSV,60 MB,CC0,"2,715 views",303 downloads,2 kernels,2 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/bls/wage-estimates,"Context:
The Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) and National Compensation Survey (NCS) programs have produced estimates by borrowing from the strength and breadth of each survey to provide more details on occupational wages than either program provides individually. Modeled wage estimates provide annual estimates of average hourly wages for occupations by selected job characteristics and within geographical location. The job characteristics include bargaining status (union and nonunion), part- and full-time work status, incentive- and time-based pay, and work levels by occupation.
Direct estimates are based on survey responses only from the particular geographic area to which the estimate refers. In contrast, modeled wage estimates use survey responses from larger areas to fill in information for smaller areas where the sample size is not sufficient to produce direct estimates. Modeled wage estimates require the assumption that the patterns to responses in the larger area hold in the smaller area.
The sample size for the NCS is not large enough to produce direct estimates by area, occupation, and job characteristic for all of the areas for which the OES publishes estimates by area and occupation. The NCS sample consists of 6 private industry panels with approximately 3,300 establishments sampled per panel, and 1,600 sampled state and local government units. The OES full six-panel sample consists of nearly 1.2 million establishments.
The sample establishments are classified in industry categories based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Within an establishment, specific job categories are selected to represent broader occupational definitions. Jobs are classified according to the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system.
Content:
Summary: Average hourly wage estimates for civilian workers in occupations by job characteristic and work levels. These data are available at the national, state, metropolitan, and nonmetropolitan area levels.

The online sports gambling industry employs teams of data analysts to build forecast models that turn the odds at sports games in their favour. While several betting strategies have been proposed to beat bookmakers, from expert prediction models and arbitrage strategies to odds bias exploitation, their returns have been inconsistent and it remains to be shown that a betting strategy can outperform the online sports betting market. We designed a strategy to beat football bookmakers with their own numbers:
""Beating the bookies with their own numbers - and how the online sports betting market is rigged"", by Lisandro Kaunitz, Shenjun Zhong and Javier Kreiner.
Here, we make the full dataset publicly available to the Kaggle community. We also provide the codes, raw SQL database and the online real-time dashboard that were used for our study on github.
Our strategy proved profitable in a 10-year historical simulation using closing odds, a 6-month historical simulation using minute to minute odds, and a 5-month period during which we staked real money with the bookmakers. We would like to challenge the Kaggle community to improve our results:
Can your strategy consistently beat the sports betting market over thousands of bets across leagues around the world?
Do time series odds movements offer insightful information that a betting strategy can exploit?
Can you outperform the bookmakers‚Äô predictions included in the odds data by creating a better model?

Racing Kings (chess variant),Over 1.5 million racing king chess variant positions,SalvadorDali,10,"Version 1,2016-11-29",board games,CSV,81 MB,ODbL,"5,986 views",134 downloads,6 kernels,4 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/salvadordali/racingkings,"1.8 million positions of racing king chess variant
Racing kings is a popular chess variant.
Each player has a standard set of pieces without pawns. The opening setup is as below.
In this game, check is entirely forbidden: not only is it forbidden to move ones king into check, but it is also forbidden to check the opponents king. The purpose of the game is to be the first player that moves his king to the eight row. When white moves their king to the eight row, and black moves directly after that also their king to the last row, the game is a draw (this rule is to compensate for the advantage of white that they may move first.) Apart from the above, pieces move and capture precisely as in normal chess.
To learn a little bit more about a game and to experience the evaluation of the position, you can play a couple of games here. Do not forget to select Racing kings chess variant and to analyse the game at the end with the machine. Keep in mind that the evaluation score on lichess website is from -10 to 10 and slightly different than in my dataset.
What you get:
2 csv files train.csv and validate.csv with 1.5 mln and ~0.35 mln positions. Both have an identical structure: FEN of the position and the score.
The score is real value in [-1, 1] range. The closer it is to 1/-1, the more probable is the win of a white/black player. Due to the symmetry I will explain the score only for a white player (for black is the same just with a negative sign.
1 means that white already won (the game is already finished)
0.98 white has a guaranteed(*) win in maximum 1 move
0.96 ... 2 moves
0.94 ... 3 moves
....
0.82 ... in 9 moves
0.80 ... in 10 or more moves
from 0.4 to 0.8 - white has big advantage. For a good player it is not hard to win in such situation
from 0.2 to 0.4 - white has some advantage. Might be hard to convert it to a win
from 0 to 0.2 - white has tiny advantage
0 means that the position is either a draw or very close to a draw
(*) Guaranteed means that the machine has found a forced sequence of moves that allows white player to win no matter what moves the opponent will make. If the opponent makes the best moves - the game will finish in x moves, but it can finish faster if the black player makes a mistake.
Your goal is to use predict a score of the position knowing its FEN.
Use train.csv to build your model and evaluate the performance on the validate.csv dataset (without looking/using it). I used MAE score in my analysis.
Construction of the dataset
Dataset was constructed by me. I created a bot that plays many games against itself. The bot takes 1 second to analyse the position and selects the move based on the score of position. It took almost a month to generate these positions.
What is the purpose?

I was curious about the hot topics in quantum physics as reflected by the quant-ph category on arXiv. Citation counts have a long lag, and so do journal publications, and I wanted a more immediate measure of interest. SciRate is fairly well known in this community, and I noticed that after the initial two-three weeks, the number of Scites a paper gets hardly increases further. So the number of Scites is both immediate and near constant after a short while.
Content
The main dataset (scirate_quant-ph.csv) is the metadata of all papers published in quant-ph between 2012-01-01 and 2016-12-31 that had at least ten Scites, as crawled on 2016-12-31. It has six columns:
The id column as exported by pandas.
The arXiv id.
The year of publication.
The month of publication.
The day of publication.
The number of Scites (this column defines the order).
The title.
All authors separates by a semicolon.
The abstract.
The author names were subjected to normalization and the chances are high that the same author only appears with a unique name.
The name normalization was the difficult part in compiling this collection, and this is why the number of Scites was lower bounded. A second file (scirate_quant-ph_unnormalized.csv) includes all papers that appeared between 2012-2016 irrespective of the number of Scites, but the author names are not normalized. The actual number of Scites for each paper may show a slight variation between the two datasets because the unnormalized version was compiled more than a month later.

Web crawler for real estate market,Identify mispriced places in the residential rental market,Fr√©d√©ric Girod,10,"Version 3,2017-03-24|Version 2,2017-03-24|Version 1,2017-03-21","home

How does it work ?
You scrape the property ads (sale or rent) on internet and you get a dataset.
Then 3 fancy solutions are possible:
Run your webcrawler everyday for a specific place, upload the data in your data warehouse, and monitor the trends in real estate market prices.
Apply machine learning to your database and get a sense of the relative expensiveness of the properties.
Localize every property ads on a Google map using color-coded points in order to visualize the most cheap and expensive neighborhoods.
Original Data Source
For the sake of example, and for proximity reasons, we fetched information from a mid-sized Swiss city, called Lausanne, based in the south of Switzerland. The country has the particularity that people get often puzzled by the level of prices swarming almost everywhere in the rental markets. This is mostly related to the very high living standards prevailing over here. So we used one of the public property ads available in this french-speaking part of the country : https://www.homegate.ch/
Because the booming Swiss housing market is mainly a rental market (foreign investments have been riding high for the sales of property, and mortgage loans are closed to record low), I focused on real estate for rent ads in the Homegate website.
Building a webcrawler
In the Kernels section, you will find out how the Python looks like. I used BeautifulSoup and Urllib Python libraries to grab data from the website. As you can figure out, the code is simple, but really efficient.
What you get
In this example, I extracted data as of 03/17/2017, and I named the DataFrame ""Output"", available in CSV format to make the data compatible with most commonly preferred tools for analysis. It allows you to get a DataFrame with 12 columns:
the date
is it a rent or a buy
the location
the address of the property
the zip code
the available description of the property
the number of rooms
the surface
the floor
the price
the source
Machine learning
In the Kernels section, you will see a very simple ML algorithm applied to the dataset in order to the ""theoretical"" price of each asset, at the end of the code. For the sake of simplicity, I ran a very straightforward linear regression using only 3 features (the 3 only quantitative factors I have at hand) :
the number of rooms
the floor
the surface
I know what you're thinking right at the moment : those 3 features can barely explain the price of a property. Other determinants, such as the location, the neighborhood, the fact that it is outdated, badly maintained by a students roommate partying every night, ... , are of interest when it comes to assessing an appartment. But straightaway, I reduced the model to this.
Google Map display of the property ads and their relative expensiveness
cf Capture.PNG file
Upcoming improvements
Add new features to machine learning process, especially a dummy variable accounting for the neighborhood to which the property pertains.
See to what extent a logistic regression could overcome a linear regressor.
Test more complex machine learning algorithms.
Display trends in rental property prices, for each neighborhood, after establishing a larger database (with a few weeks of scraped data)."

On 9 August 2017, the Treasurer, under the Census and Statistics Act 1905, directed the Australian Statistician to collect and publish statistical information from all eligible Australians on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll, about their views on whether or not the law should be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry.
The voluntary survey asked one question: should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry? Respondents were asked to mark one box ‚Äì Yes or No ‚Äì on the survey form.
Survey materials were mailed to eligible Australians on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll as at 24 August 2017.
A range of strategies were implemented to assist all eligible Australians who wished to complete the survey to do so. A survey response was received from 12,727,920 (79.5%) eligible Australians.
The ABS implemented robust systems and controls for the processing, coding and publication of statistical data. Detailed information on the systems used as well as the accuracy and integrity of the data is available in the Survey Process and the Quality and Integrity Statement.
The official statistics include a count of responses (Yes, No and Response Not Clear) by Federal Electoral Division (FED), State/Territory and National. This also includes a count of eligible Australians who have not participated in the survey.
Information from the Commonwealth Electoral Roll has been used to independently produce a participation rate by age and gender for each FED, State/Territory and National. This rate has been published by gender, for each of the following age groups: 18-19 years, 20-24 years, 25-29 years, 30-34 years, 35-39 years, 40-44 years, 45-49 years, 50-54 years, 55-59 years, 60-64 years, 65-69 years, 70-74 years, 75-79 years, 80-84 years, and 85+ years.
National results
Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?
Of the eligible Australians who expressed a view on this question, the majority indicated that the law should be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry, with 7,817,247 (61.6%) responding Yes and 4,873,987 (38.4%) responding No. Nearly 8 out of 10 eligible Australians (79.5%) expressed their view.
All states and territories recorded a majority Yes response. 133 of the 150 Federal Electoral Divisions recorded a majority Yes response, and 17 of the 150 Federal Electoral Divisions recorded a majority No response.

Sadly, Seoul, South Korea has some of the most polluted air in the world. Since Seoul also represents 25-50% of the South Korean population, the air quality is a concern to many.
It used to be that in Korea, we have bad air quality in spring (yellow wind blowing from the Chinese Yellow River), and clear air in autumn. Now with more industries in China, the air is getting worse in Korea in a different seasonality pattern. This is known as Asian Dust.

The company list is from the publicly available 1st November 2017 Companies House snapshot.
The postcode geolocations and SIC Codes are from the gov.uk website.
In the file AllCompanies.csv each row is formatted as follows:

Inspiration Possible uses for this data is to see where certain types of companies are located in the UK, and how over time they multiply and spread throughout the UK.
Training ML algorithms to predict where there are a high (or low) density of certain types of companies, and where would be a good area for a company to be located, if it wanted minimal competition, or the inverse, where there are clusters of high densities, where it might be easier to recruit specialised staff.
A useful addition would be to overlay population density, which I am currently working on as an option for this dataset.
I am sure there are many more possible uses for this data in ways, that I cannot imagine.

SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library Online) is an international research communication program launched in 1998 and implemented through a decentralized network of national collections of peer reviewed journals from 15 countries ‚Äì 12 from Latin America, Portugal, Spain and South Africa ‚Äì that jointly publish over 1 thousand journals and about 50 thousand articles per year. A thematic collection on Public Health is also operated by the SciELO Program. All collections are accessible via the network portal ‚Äì http://www.scielo.org.
SciELO aims at the progress of research through the improvement of peer reviewed journals from all disciplines published by scientific and professional associations, academic institutions and public or private research and development institutions. The specific objectives are to increase in a sustainable way the quality, visibility, usage, impact and credibility of the indexed journals and the research they communicate. A key characteristic of SciELO is multilingual publishing, so journals can publish articles in one or multiple languages including the simultaneous publishing of the same article in more than one language.
SciELO Program develops itself according to three principles. First, the conception that scientific knowledge is a public good and therefore should be available openly in the Web. Second, the network operation envisaging to strengthen collaboration and interchange of information and experience, creating scale and lessen the costs. Third, quality control as an essential policy and practice at the level of articles, journals and collections, adoption and compliance with bibliographic and interoperability standards.
SciELO operation and development are carried out following three main action lines. The first is professionalization, which means to produce journals according to the state of art. The second is internationalization, which means to strengthen the active participation of SciELO Journals and Program in the international flow of scientific information. The third is operational and financial sustainability, which means to develop conditions to assure journals to be published on time with a well-established financial model.
All collections follow the SciELO Publishing Model, which comprises three main functions. First, the indexing of journals with metadata of articles, including the bibliographic references of the indexed articles and of the articles they cite. Second, the full text of articles which are available in HTML, PDF and progressively in XML JATS compatible according the SciELO Publishing Schema. Third, the dissemination and interoperability of journals and articles with bibliographic indexes and systems.
SciELO Brazil, led by SciELO / FAPESP Program, acts as the SciELO Network secretariat and coordinates the maintenance of the methodological and technological platform, while the operation of the network collections and journals are decentralized and led by national research agencies.
Content
This dataset contains publication and access reports for the documents of the SciELO Brazil collection between 1998 and October 2017.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the very first public and open dataset with high quality images of paintings, which also takes density (in Pixels Per Inch) into consideration. The main research question we wanted to address was: Is it possible to distinguish Vincent van Gogh's paintings from his contemporaries? Our method achieved a F1-score of 92.3%.
There are many possibilities for future work, such as:
Increase the dataset. This includes Wikimedia Commons and WikiArt. Unfortunately, Google Art Project does not allow downloads.
Deal with density normalization. There is a lot of data available without such normalization (e.g., Painting-91 and Painter by Numbers). It is possible analyze how this affects accuracy.
Experiment with multi-class and open-set recognition.
Try to identify the painting style, movement, or school.
Maybe study painting authorship verification: given two paintings, are they from the same author?
Is it possible to detect artificially generated paintings? Are they useful for dataset augmentation?

FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE GROUPLENS RESEARCH PROJECT
The GroupLens Research Project is a research group in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. Members of the GroupLens Research Project are involved in many research projects related to the fields of information filtering, collaborative filtering, and recommender systems. The project is lead by professors John Riedl and Joseph Konstan. The project began to explore automated collaborative filtering in 1992, but is most well known for its world wide trial of an automated collaborative filtering system for Usenet news in 1996. The technology developed in the Usenet trial formed the base for the formation of Net Perceptions, Inc., which was founded by members of GroupLens Research. Since then the project has expanded its scope to research overall information filtering solutions, integrating in content-based methods as well as improving current collaborative filtering technology.

Traveling great distances in short time, those aircrafts have brought several advantaged for the world, both in commercial and regular application. Unfortunately, as any transport mean, aircrafts have their own count of tragedies. The last event envolving airplanes - to the publication date - was the accident envolving the brazilian soccer team Chapecoense and a LAMIA's aircraft, which was transporting them to Colombia for a Championship. This tragedy brought back discussions and controversies about aircraft's security and human capacity during aeronautics occurrences.

Pakistan has a rich multilingual and multicultural heritage, with about 70 spoken languages, deriving from a diverse set of Indo-Aryan, Indo-Iranian, Sino-Tibetan and Dravidian language families. More than half of these languages also have a written form, employing (predominantly) Perso-Arabic Nastalique and Arabic Naskh writing styles. Gujarati, Gurmuki and Tibetan scripts are also used by some communities, while some others are in the process of defining their writing systems. These languages exhibit a diverse set of sounds and underlying linguistic structures which are both linguistically and computationally exciting and challenging. Most of these languages are not well-studied or well-modeled, and present a vast training ground for researchers in linguistics and computer science.
This dataset provides resources for two languages spoken in Pakistan: Nepali and Urdu. Urdu is the national language of Pakistan, while Nepali is mainly spoken in a small immigrant community.

Abstract
(from the original paper)
Mating behavior has profound consequences for two phenomena‚Äîindividual reproductive success and the maintenance of species boundaries‚Äîthat contribute to evolutionary processes. Studies of mating behavior in relation to individual reproductive success are common in many species, but studies of mating behavior in relation to genetic variation and species boundaries are less commonly conducted in socially complex species. Here we leveraged extensive observations of a wild yellow baboon (Papio cynocephalus) population that has experienced recent gene flow from a close sister taxon, the anubis baboon (Papio anubis), to examine how admixture-related genetic background affects mating behavior. We identified novel effects of genetic background on mating patterns, including an advantage accruing to anubis-like males and assortative mating among both yellow-like and anubis-like pairs. These genetic effects acted alongside social dominance rank, inbreeding avoidance, and age to produce highly nonrandom mating patterns. Our results suggest that this population may be undergoing admixture-related evolutionary change, driven in part by nonrandom mating. However, the strength of the genetic effect is mediated by behavioral plasticity and social interactions, emphasizing the strong influence of social context on mating behavior in socially complex species.
The Data
This dataset contains over 12,000 observations of the following variables:
female_id: three letter ""short name"" ID for the female in a potentially consorting pair; each female has a unique ID
male_id: three letter ""short name"" ID for the male in a potentially consorting pair; each male has a unique ID
cycle_id: a unique number assigned to each female-estrus cycle combination
consort: whether the female-male pair consorted (1) or not (0), given the opportunity to do so
conceptive: whether the estrus cycle resulted in a conception (1) or not (0)
female_hybridscore: an estimate of the proportion of the female's genome that represents anubis baboon ancestry; for details of the estimation procedure, see Materials and Methods and Tung et al (2008)
male_hybridscore: an estimate of the proportion of the male's genome that represents anubis baboon ancestry; for details of the estimation procedure, see Materials and Methods and Tung et al (2008)
female_gendiv: an estimate of the female's genetic diversity; for details of the estimation procedure, see Materials and Methods
male_gendiv: an estimate of the male's genetic diversity; for details of the estimation procedure, see Materials and Methods
gen_distance: an estimate of the genetic distance (Queller-Goodnight r) between the male and female of a potentially consorting pair
female_age: the age of the female in a potentially consorting pair
male_rank: the ordinal rank of the male in a potentially consorting pair
female_rank: the ordinal rank of the female in a potentially consorting pair
males_present: the number of adult males present in the group of the potentially consorting pair
females_present: the number of adult females present in the group of the potentially consorting pair
male_rank_transform: ordinal male rank transformed to reflect fit (given number of males in a group) to the priority-of-access model; see Materials and Methods and Appendix for more details
gen_distance_transform: genetic distance estimate transform to test whether consortship probabilities decrease with genetic distance as well as genetic similarity
rank_interact: the multiplicative interaction of male rank and female rank in the potentially consorting pair
assort_index: assortative mating index, calculated from the hybrid scores of the male and female of a potentially consorting pair; see Materials and Methods for additional detail
female_age_transform: female age transformed to test for a higher probability of consortship behavior for maximally fertile (middle-aged) females
Inspiration
Here are a few ideas for things to look at in this dataset:
does genetic distance affect mating probability?
does age of the female baboon affect conception probability?
does social rank of the male affect mating probability?"

This dataset contains information on pesticide residues in food. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) conducts the Pesticide Data Program (PDP) every year to help assure consumers that the food they feed themselves and their families is safe. Ultimately, if EPA determines a pesticide is not safe for human consumption, it is removed from the market.
The PDP tests a wide variety of domestic and imported foods, with a strong focus on foods that are consumed by infants and children. EPA relies on PDP data to conduct dietary risk assessments and to ensure that any pesticide residues in foods remain at safe levels. USDA uses the data to better understand the relationship of pesticide residues to agricultural practices and to enhance USDA‚Äôs Integrated Pest Management objectives. USDA also works with U.S. growers to improve agricultural practices.
Content
While the original 2013 MS Access database can be found here, the data has been transferred to a SQLite database for easier, more open use. The database contains two tables, Sample Data and Results Data. Each sampling includes attributes such as extraction method, the laboratory responsible for the test, and EPA tolerances among others. These attributes are labeled with codes, which can be referenced in PDF format here, or integrated into the database using the included csv files.
Inspiration
What are the most common types of pesticides tested in this study?
Do certain states tend to use one particular pesticide type over another?
Does pesticide type correspond more with crop type or location (state)?
Are any produce types found to have higher pesticide levels than assumed safe by EPA standards?
By combining databases from several years of PDP tests, can you see any trends in pesticide use?

California Kindergarten Immunization Rates,How many new students contributed to ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù between 2000 and 2015?,Brian Roach,9,"Version 3,2017-08-30|Version 2,2017-08-30|Version 1,2017-08-12","diseases
public health",CSV,7 MB,CC0,"2,609 views",326 downloads,2 kernels,2 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/broach/california-kindergarten-immunization-rates,"Context
Vaccinations provide people the ability to develop immunity to particular diseases. When the majority of a population is vaccinated, ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù protects those who have not been vaccinated by blocking the spread of these diseases. A medical research paper published by The Lancet in 1998 suggested an association between the Measles/Mumps/Rubella (MMR) vaccine and Autism spectrum disorders. The paper was later fully-retracted due controversy surrounding the lead author, who had financial conflicts of interest and allegedly manipulated the study data. However, it generated worldwide concern over the safety of MMR and other types of vaccines, including Diphtheria/Tetanus/Pertussis (DTP).
In California by 2010, the growing trend for parents to opt out of having their children receive vaccines over the following decade coincided with the largest Pertussis outbreak in more than 60 years. Reduced vaccination frequency was also linked to a high-profile measles outbreak in 2014 that began at Disneyland. The resulting California state legislation (Senate Bill 277), signed June 2015, made it much more difficult for parents to opt out of vaccinations for their children. The data set will allow you to explore individual public and private school vaccination rates of incoming Kindergarten students for the 2000 to 2014 school years.
Content
The data are records for every school with ten or more students reporting the number of incoming Kindergarteners who provided either proof of immunization, personal beliefs exemption (PBE), or permanent medical exemption (PME). Annual records for the 2000-2001 through 2014-2015 school years have been formatted and combined. Common variables in these annual data sets included in the merged file are the number of students, school name, school county, the number of PBEs, PMEs, and number of students vaccinated for:
Diphtheria/Tetanus/Pertussis (DTP)
Polio
Measles/Mumps/Rubella (MMR)
One additional file contains 5 years of county-level Pertussis case numbers and rates. Another additional data file contains the number of infant Pertussis cases for infants under three months old for each county in California between 2014-2015.
Geographic data are available in a file based on scripted geocode calls using the ggmap R package to find latitude and longitude data using the school names and county names. Not all calls returned a valid coordinate, so additional indicator variables in this file indicate the quality of the match. The isSchool indicator variable is 1 if the geocode search meta data included ""school"" and the countyMatch indicator is 1 if the latitude and longitude coordinates are contained within the appropriate county in CA.

Have you taken a flight in the U.S. in the past 15 years? If so, then you are a part of monthly data that the U.S. Department of Transportation's TranStats service makes available on various metrics for 15 U.S. airlines and 30 major U.S airports. Their website unfortunately does not include a method for easily downloading and sharing files. Furthermore, the source is built in ASP.NET, so extracting the data is rather cumbersome. To allow easier community access to this rich source of information, I scraped the metrics for every airline / airport combination and stored them in separate CSV files.
Occasionally, an airline doesn't serve a certain airport, or it didn't serve it for the entire duration that the data collection period covers*. In those cases, the data either doesn't exist or is typically too sparse to be of much use. As such, I've only uploaded complete files for airports that an airline served for the entire uninterrupted duration of the collection period. For these files, there should be 174 time series points for one or more of the nine columns below. I recommend any of the files for American, Delta, or United Airlines for outstanding examples of complete and robust airline data.
* No data for Atlas Air exists, and Virgin America commenced service in 2007, so no folders for either airline are included.
Content
There are 13 airlines that have at least one complete dataset. Each airline's folder includes CSV file(s) for each airport that are complete as defined by the above criteria. I've double-checked the files, but if you find one that violates the criteria, please point it out. The file names have the format ""AIRLINE-AIRPORT.csv"", where both AIRLINE and AIRPORT are IATA codes. For a full listing of the airlines and airports that the codes correspond to, check out the airline_codes.csv or airport_codes.csv files that are included, or perform a lookup here. Note that the data in each airport file represents metrics for flights that originated at the airport.
Among the 13 airlines in data.zip, there are a total of 161 individual datasets. There are also two special folders included - airlines_all_airports.csv and airports_all_airlines.csv. The first contains datasets for each airline aggregated over all airports, while the second contains datasets for each airport aggregated over all airlines. To preview a sample dataset, check out all_airlines_all_airports.csv, which contains industry-wide data.
Each file includes the following metrics for each month from October 2002 to March 2017:
Date (YYYY-MM-DD): All dates are set to the first of the month. The day value is just a placeholder and has no significance.
ASM_Domestic: Available Seat-Miles in thousands (000s). Number of domestic flights * Number of seats on each flight
ASM_International*: Available Seat-Miles in thousands (000s). Number of international flights * Number of seats on each flight

The airline / airport datasets are perfect for practicing and/or testing time series forecasting with classic statistical models such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), or modern deep learning techniques such as long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The datasets typically show evidence of trends, seasonality, and noise, so modeling and accurate forecasting can be challenging, but still more tractable than time series problems possessing more stochastic elements, e.g. stocks, currencies, commodities, etc. The source releases new data each month, so feel free to check your models' performances against new data as it comes out. I will update the files here every 3 to 6 months depending on how things go.
A future plan is to build a SQLite database so a vast array of queries can be run against the data. The data in it its current time series format is not conducive for this, so coming up with a workable structure for the tables is the first step towards this goal. If you have any suggestions for how I can improve the data presentation, or anything that you would like me to add, please let me know. Looking forward to seeing the questions that we can answer together!"

Parkinson's Vision-Based Pose Estimation Dataset,Pose estimates of Parkinson's patients using deep learning,limi44,9,"Version 1,2017-09-01",,Other,132 MB,Other,"1,872 views",114 downloads,,,https://www.kaggle.com/limi44/parkinsons-visionbased-pose-estimation-dataset,"Context
The data includes 2D human pose estimates of Parkinson's patients performing a variety of tasks (e.g. communication, drinking from a cup, leg agility). Pose estimates were produced using Convolutional Pose Machines (CPM, https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00134).
The goal of this project was to use features derived from videos of Parkinson's assessment to predict the severity of parkinsonism and dyskinesia based on clinical rating scales.
Content
Data was acquired as part of a study to measure the minimally clinically important difference in Parkinson's rating scales. Participants received a two hour infusion of levodopa followed by up to two hours of observation. During this time, they were assessed at regular intervals and assessments were video recorded for post-hoc ratings by neurologists. There were between 120-130 videos per task.
The data includes all movement trajectories (extracted frame-by-frame) from the videos of Parkinson's assessments using CPM, as well as confidence values produced by CPM. Ground truth ratings of parkinsonism and dyskinesia severity are included using the UDysRS, UPDRS, and CAPSIT rating scales.
Camera shake has been removed from trajectories (see paper for more details). No other preprocessing has been performed. Files are saved in JSON format. For information on how to deal with files, see data_import_demo.ipynb or view online at https://github.com/limi44/Parkinson-s-Pose-Estimation-Dataset.

This dataset looks at the demographics of World of Warcraft players‚Äìgender, age, sexuality, etc.‚Äìand how they play the game‚Äìrole, race, class‚Äìto see if there is an association between any of them. Specifically, I was interested in how gender and sexuality affects the gender of the character they play, but there are many other things to look at. This data was gathered through a Google Forms survey, which was then posted on Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter, and my WoW guild's Discord server.
Content
There are 14 columns, 100 rows (not including the titles). 12 of those columns were gathered from a Google Forms survey, and the last two were added by hand. They are:
Timestamp: Useless. Just when the survey was completed.
Gender: The gender of the player.
Sexuality: The sexuality of the player.
Age: Age of the player.
Country: Country the player lives in.
Main: The gender of character the player mains
Faction: The faction the player mains.
Server: The server(s) the player mains.
Role: The role(s) the player mains (DPS, Healer, Tank, or any combination therein).
Class: The class(es) the player mains. This was a question where the respondent check any number of boxes, so there are many different ways it could be answered. Hard to analyze.
Race: The race(s) the player mains. Same as class.
Max: The number of 110s (max level) the player has. Only numerical variable in the dataset.
Attracted: The gender the player is attracted to.
Type: The ""type"" of person the player is. Combines gender and sexuality (""gay woman"", ""bi male"", etc.)

BuzzFeed had previously reported on flights of spy planes operated by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and reasoned that it should be possible to train a machine learning algorthim to identify other aircraft performing similar surveillance, based on characteristics of the aircraft and their flight patterns. You can read the story here, and additional analysis and code by Peter Aldhous can be found here.
Content:
BuzzFeed News obtained more than four months of aircraft transponder detections from the plane tracking website Flightradar24, covering August 17 to December 31, 2015 UTC, containing all data displayed on the site within a bounding box encompassing the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.
Flightradar24 receives data from its network of ground-based receivers, supplemented by a feed from ground radars provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) with a five-minute delay.
After parsing from the raw files supplied by Flightradar24, the data included the following fields, for each transponder detection:
adshex Unique identifier for each aircraft, corresponding to its ""Mode-S"" code, in hexademical format.
flight_id Unique identifier for each ""flight segment,"" in hexadecimal format. A flight segment is a continuous series of transponder detections for one aircraft. There may be more than one segment per flight, if a plane disappears from Flightradar24's coverage for a period --- for example when flying over rural areas with sparse receiver coverage. While being tracked by Fightradar24, planes were typically detected several times per minute.
latitude, longitude Geographic location in digital degrees.
altitude Altitude in feet.
speed Ground speed in knots.
squawk Four-digit code transmitted by the transponder.
type Aircraft manufacter and model, if identified.
timestamp Full UTC timestamp.
track Compass bearing in degrees, with 0 corresponding to north.
We also calculated:
steer Change in compass bearing from the previous transponder detection for that aircraft; negative values indicate a turn to the left, positive values a turn to the right.
Feature engineering
First we filtered the data to remove planes registered abroad, based on their adshex code, common commercial airliners, based on their type, and aircraft with fewer than 500 transponder detections.
Then we took a random sample of 500 aircraft and calculated the following for each one:
duration of each flight segment recorded by Flightradar24, in minutes.
boxes Area of a rectangular bounding box drawn around each flight segment, in square kilometers.
Finally, we calculated the following variables for each of the aircraft in the larger filtered dataset:
duration1,duration2,duration3,duration4,duration5 Proportion of flight segment durations for each plane falling into each of five quantiles calculated from duration for the sample of 500 planes. The proportions for each aircraft must add up to 1; if the durations of flight segments for a plane closely matched those for a typical plane from the sample, these numbers would all approximate to 0.2; a plane that mostly flew very long flights would have large decimal fraction for duration5.
boxes1,boxes2,boxes3,boxes4,boxes5 Proportion of bounding box areas for each plane falling into each of five quantiles calculated from boxes for the sample of 500 planes.
speed1,speed2,speed3,speed4,speed5 Proportion of speed values recorded for the aircraft falling into each of five quantiles recorded for speed for the sample of 500 planes.
altitude1,altitude2,altitude3,altitude4,altitude5 Proportion of altitude values recorded for the aircraft falling into each of five quantiles recorded for altitude for the sample of 500 planes.
steer1,steer2,steer3,steer4,steer5,steer6,steer7,steer8 Proportion of steer values for each aircraft falling into bins set manually, after observing the distribution for the sample of 500 planes, using the breaks: -180, -25, -10, -1, 0, 1, 22, 45, 180.
flights Total number of flight segments for each plane.
squawk_1 Squawk code used most commonly by the aircraft.
observations Total number of transponder detections for each plane.
type Aircraft manufacter and model, if identified, else unknown.
The resulting data for 19,799 aircraft are in the file planes_features.csv.

What The Study Is Not
The Open Data 500 is not a rating or ranking of companies. It covers companies of different sizes and categories, using various kinds of data.
The Open Data 500 is not a competition, but an attempt to give a broad, inclusive view of the field.
The Open Data 500 study also does not provide a random sample for definitive statistical analysis. Since this is the first thorough scan of companies in the field, it is not yet possible to determine the exact landscape of open data companies."

Indoor location determination with RSSI,"120K RSSI samples to determine X,Y,Z coordinates in a two-level building",Amir Malekpour,9,"Version 2,2018-01-19|Version 1,2018-01-19",internet,CSV,380 KB,CC4,613 views,57 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/amirma/indoor-location-determination-with-rssi,"Context
In 2007, I wrote my masters thesis on indoor location determination using Wi-Fi received signal strength indicator (RSSI). As a part of my research, I gathered 120K RSSI samples from 4 access points on floor 1 and 2 of the building of my faculty. I wrote a custom software to do this (no reliable open source software for this at the time) and sampling was a long and painful process. With my limited ML learning skills at the time, I came up with a simple algorithm that was able to find the location of a Wi-Fi device in that building with 85% accuracy. I imagine this is a solved problem now and state of the art indoor positioning systems are way more accurate today. Yet, I decided to find and publish this data set because it's small and simple enough for practice and at the same time, it has some peculiarity for advanced data science and ML fun.
Content
The samples were taken in a two-level building. Each row in the dataset is a single RSSI sample from one of the 4 access points. Access points are identified by one of the letters A, B, C, or D. Physical coordinates of the location where each sample was taken is identified by X,Y, Z coordinates with Z being the floor (1 or 2). At each coordinate, multiple samples are taken, where sample number is identified by a field name sequence. The reason for taking multiple samples is that signal strength fluctuates due to things like scattering and reflection, specially in buildings with moving objects and people. So, to have reliable measurements, one needs 10s of samples from each access points to make for the variability.
Having- said this, each row of the sample set has the format: ap ,signal, sequence ,x,y,z where:
ap: Access point identifier. one of A, B, C or D
signal: Signal strength from access point ap. Note: RSSI values in the table are negated. That is, smaller values in this cell mean stronger signal reception from the access point.
sequence: The sequence of sample from this particular access point at this particular coordinate
x,y,z:: Coordinates where this sample was taken
Note: do not assume all locations have the same number of samples from all access points. For example, at location (x=1,y=1,z=1) we might have a samples from A, b samples from B, c samples from C and d samples from D and a != b != c!= d. Why? That's because in some areas we might have poor reception (or complete lack thereof) from an access point and so we end up with fewer or no samples.
Here's the floor plan of the building where sampling took place
These are the locations of the access points:
{""A"": (23, 17, 2), ""B"": (23, 41, 2), ""C"" : (1, 15, 2), ""D"": (1, 41, 2)}
You can also find the location of access points on the map.
By poking at this data and comparing it with the floor plan, you'll learn interesting things about Wi-Fi radio signals (in 2.4 GHz frequency) and how they behave in indoors. One challenge is to come up with a ML model that given RSSI from the 4 access points finds the (x,y,z) coordinates of the location."

Capital punishment is one of the controversial human rights issues in the United States. While surfing the Internet for an interesting dataset, I came across this database by Texas Department of Criminal Justice, which comprises of the offenders' last words before execution. Some of the statements are:
""...Young people, listen to your parents; always do what they tell you to do, go to school, learn from your mistakes. Be careful before you sign anything with your name. Never, despite what other people say..."" (Ramiro Hernandez, executed on April 9th, 2014)
""First and foremost I'd like to say, ""Justice has never advanced by taking a life"" by Coretta Scott King. Lastly, to my wife and to my kids, I love y'all forever and always. That's it."" (Taichin Preyor, executed on July 27th, 2017)
As I skimmed these lines, I decided to create this dataset.
2. Content
This dataset includes information on criminals executed by Texas Department of Criminal Justice from 1982 to November 8th, 2017. In Furman v Georgia in 1972, the Supreme Court considered a group of consolidated cases, whereby it severely restricted the death penalty. However, like other states, Texas adjusted its legislation to address the Court's concern and once again allow for capital punishment in 1973. Texas adopted execution by lethal injection in 1977 and in 1982, the starting year of this dataset, the first offender was executed by this method.
The dataset consists of 545 observations with 21 variables. They are:
- Execution: The order of execution, numeric.
- LastName: Last name of the offender, character.
- FirstName: First name of the offender, character.
- TDCJNumber: TDCJ Number of the offender, numeric.
- Age: Age of the offender, numeric.
- Race: Race of the offender, categorical : Black, Hispanic, White, Other.
- CountyOfConviction: County of conviction, character.
- AgeWhenReceived: Age of offender when received, numeric.
- EducationLevel: Education level of offender, numeric.
- Native County: Native county of offender, categorical : 0 = Within Texas, 1= Outside Texas.
- PreviousCrime : Whether the offender committed any crime before, categorical: 0= No, 1= Yes.
- Codefendants: Number of co-defendants, numeric.
- NumberVictim: Number of victims, numeric.
- WhiteVictim, HispanicVictim, BlackVictim, VictimOtherRace. FemaleVictim, MaleVictim: Number of victims with specified demographic features, numeric.
- LastStatement: Last statement of offender, character.

This dataset is derived from the database by Texas Department of Criminal Justice which can be found in this link: http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/death_row/dr_executed_offenders.html . It can be seen that the original one has fewer than 10 variables and is embedded with some links to sub-datasets, so I manually inputted more variables based on those links.
There are some complications with this dataset. Firstly, the dataset was manually created so mistakes are inevitable, though I have tried my best to minimize them. Secondly, the recording of offender information is not complete and consistent. For example, sometimes the education level of GED is interpreted as 11 years, at other times as 9 or 10 years. ""None"" and ""NA"" are used interchangeably, making it hard to distinguish between 0 and NA in the coded variable. The victim's information is often omitted, so I rely on the description of the crime for the names and pronouns to make a judgement of the number of victims and their gender. Finally, the last statements are sometimes recorded in the first person and sometimes in the third, so the word choice might not be original. That being said, I find this dataset meaningful and worth sharing.

The dataset was created using the RSSI readings of an array of 13 ibeacons in the first floor of Waldo Library, Western Michigan University. Data was collected using iPhone 6S. The dataset contains two sub-datasets: a labeled dataset (1420 instances) and an unlabeled dataset (5191 instances). The recording was performed during the operational hours of the library. For the labeled dataset, the input data contains the location (label column), a timestamp, followed by RSSI readings of 13 iBeacons. RSSI measurements are negative values. Bigger RSSI values indicate closer proximity to a given iBeacon (e.g., RSSI of -65 represent a closer distance to a given iBeacon compared to RSSI of -85). For out-of-range iBeacons, the RSSI is indicated by -200. The locations related to RSSI readings are combined in one column consisting a letter for the column and a number for the row of the position. The following figure depicts the layout of the iBeacons as well as the arrange of locations.
Attribute Information
location: The location of receiving RSSIs from ibeacons b3001 to b3013; symbolic values showing the column and row of the location on the map (e.g., A01 stands for column A, row 1).
date: Datetime in the format of ‚Äòd-m-yyyy hh:mm:ss‚Äô
b3001 - b3013: RSSI readings corresponding to the iBeacons; numeric, integers only.

While GPS enabled devices can guide you path on street or on roads. These devices are limited in their usage because these can‚Äôt help in walking thorough the enclosed spaces like rooms etc. and thus limitation for blind people to walk in enclosed space.¬¨ We come up with an idea to model first person walk in rooms to come out from the rooms or enclosed spaces like whenever any person sees a wall in front of him he moves to right or left and fine tune his direction and get out of the room and avoids wall collisions. So we have collected data to guide a person especially blind person to go out of room doors. The typical workflow consists of approach of Computer vision in the following way: The data for first person walking simulator is gathered in a game environment where room‚Äôs maps are created and images are captured and labelled walk by Forward, Left and Right classes. Typically human walk is more complicated, but we in this stage only collected three type of action. In the aim to predict the direction to come out of the room.
Content:
A human first recognize the view in front of him and then decides an action by taking Step in forward, sideways, left , right or more complex movement. The same is done during data gathering stage i.e. we captured image first and labelled as Forward if agent can move forward or right if he need to turn right to go out of the door/room.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

Data Set Information:
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
Check the README.txt file for further details about this dataset.
An updated version of this dataset can be found at (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones) It includes labels of postural transitions between activities and also the full raw inertial signals instead of the ones pre-processed into windows."

BART, short for ""Bay Area Rapid Transit"", is the transit system severing the San Francisco Bay Area in California. BART operates six routes, 46 stations, and and 112 miles of track. It serves an average weekday ridership of 423,000 people, making it the fifth-busiest rapid transit system in the United States.
This dataset contains daily information on BART ridership for a period covering all of 2016 and part of 2017. Unlike some other rapid transit system datasets, this data includes movements between specific stations (there are just over 2000 station-to-station combinations).
Content
This dataset is split in three files. station_info.csv includes generic information on individual stations. date-hour-soo-dest-2017.csv contains daily inter-station ridership for (part of) 2017. date-hour-soo-dest-2016.csv contains daily inter-station ridership for all of 2016.

We would like to have good open source speech recognition
Commercial companies try to solve a hard problem: map arbitrary, open-ended speech to text and identify meaning
The easier problem should be: detect a predefined sequence of sounds and map it to a predefined action.
Lets tackle the simplest problem first: Classifying single, short words (commands)
Audio training data is difficult to obtain.
Approaches
The parent project (spoken verbs) created synthetic speech datasets using text-to-speech programs. The focus there is on single-syllable verbs (commands).
The Speech Commands dataset (by Pete Warden, see the TensorFlow Speech Recognition Challenge) asked volunteers to pronounce a small set of words: (yes, no, up, down, left, right, on, off, stop, go, and 0-9).
This data set provides synthetic counterparts to this real world dataset.
Open questions
One can use these two datasets in various ways. Here are some things I am interested in seeing answered:
What is it in an audio sample that makes it ""sound similar""? Our ears can easily classify both synthetic and real speech, but for algorithms this is still hard. Extending the real dataset with the synthetic data yields a larger training sample and more diversity.
How well does an algorithm trained on one data set perform on the other? (transfer learning) If it works poorly, the algorithm probably has not found the key to audio similarity.
Are synthetic data sufficient for classifying real datasets? If this is the case, the implications are huge. You would not need to ask thousands of volunteers for hours of time. Instead, you could easily create arbitrary synthetic datasets for your target words.
A interesting challenge (idea for competition) would be to train on this data set and evaluate on the real dataset.
Synthetic data creation
Here I describe how the synthetic audio samples were created. Code is available at https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/spoken-command-recognition, in the ""tensorflow-speech-words"" folder.
The list of words is in ""inputwords"". ""marvin"" was changed to ""marvel"", because ""marvin"" does not have a pronounciation coding yet.
Pronounciations were taken from the British English Example Pronciation dictionary (BEEP, http://svr-www.eng.cam.ac.uk/comp.speech/Section1/Lexical/beep.html ). The phonemes were translated for the next step with a translation table (see compile.py for details). This creates the file ""words"". There are multiple pronounciations and stresses for each word.
A text-to-speech program (espeak) was used to pronounce these words (see generatetfspeech.sh for details). The pronounciation, stress, pitch, speed and speaker were varied. This gives >1000 clean examples for each word.
Noise samples were obtained. Noise samples (airport babble car exhibition restaurant street subway train) come from AURORA (https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/sounds/noise/), and additional noise samples were synthetically created (ocean white brown pink). (see ../generatenoise.sh for details)
Noise and speech were mixed. The speech volume and offset were varied. The noise source, volume was also varied. See addnoise.py for details. addnoise2.py is the same, but with lower speech volume and higher noise volume. All audio files are one second (1s) long and are in wav format (16 bit, mono, 16000 Hz).
Finally, the data was compressed into an archive and uploaded to kaggle.

Shark Tank is a great show based on an interesting concept wherein entrepreneurs and founders pitch their businesses in front of seasoned investors (aka sharks) who decide whether or not to invest in the businesses based on multiple parameters.
The show has many versions in different regions, and this database is for the US version, featuring, among other guest sharks, Mark Cuban, Robert Herjavec, Daymond John, Kevin O'Leary, Barbara Corcoran, and Lori Greiner.
The investment decisions on the show are merely handshake deals which are followed up by a detailed due-diligence and subsequent final investment decisions. Many of the deals taking place on the show do not go through.
Among many other points, some of the major decision vectors for the sharks to make a deal are:
The relevance of the business to their fields of interest and exposure (Daymond for fashion, Lori for QVC, Kevin for Wines, etc.)
The pitch quality (preparation, energy, etc. of the presenter)
Health of the business (Financials, debts, etc.)
Valuation (The most important)
Since elements such as pitch quality, exact financials disclosed, and specifics of what communication happened between the sharks and the presenters can be considered to be copyrighted to the show, I picked up the publically available details of the pitches and the results (deal = YES OR NO) and the associated shark(s) from websites, consolidated and cleaned the data, and presented in this dataset.
The idea is that a text vector based learning algorithm might be able to predict, given a description of a new pitch, how likely is the pitch to succeed in the shark tank, and even which shark might be more interested in the pitch.
Content
The dataset contains following headers:
Season_Epi_code - The data spans all 8 seasons of Shark Tank (US) and this code gives the season and the episode for indexing purposes. Format = SEE (101 = 1st season 1st Episode, 826 = 8th season 26th Episode)
Pitched_Business_Identifier - A short name of the pitched business
Pitched_Business_Desc - Brief description of the pitched business. Combination of text from more than one source has been added here, and there might be repetition or a very small description.
Deal_Status - Status of whether the pitched business got a deal in the episode where at least one shark and the presenters agreed on a particular deal. Format = (YES = 1, NO = 0)
Deal_Shark - Which of the most common sharks agreed on the episode along with the presenters for a deal? Format = either single shark's initials or '+' separated values of more than one shark's initials
Initials used: BC - Barbara Corcoran DJ - Daymond John KOL - Kevin O'Leary LG - Lori Greiner MC - Mark Cuban RH - Robert Herjavec
Note: While I have tried my best to collect, consolidate and clean the data, I do not make any claims of completeness or accuracy of data in the dataset. The user assumes the entire risk with respect to the use of this dataset.

The Thai language is the primary language of Thailand and a recognized minority language in Cambodia. It has approximately twenty million native speakers, in addition to 44 million second language speakers. It is written in Thai script (also called the Thai alphabet) which is notable for being the first writing system to incorporate tonal markers. Thai is written without spaces between words.
Content:
The HSE Thai Corpus is a corpus of modern texts written in Thai language. The texts, containing in whole 50 million tokens, were collected from various Thai websites (mostly news websites). To make it easier for non-Thai-speakers to comprehend and use texts in the corpus the researchers decided to separate words in each sentence with spaces.
The data for the corpus was collected by means of Scrapy. To tokenize texts the Pythai module was used. The text in this dataset is encoded in UTF-8.
The corpus can be searched using a web interface at this site.
This dataset contains text from two sources: Wikipedia and thaigov.go.th. The former is licensed under a standard Wikipedia license, and the latter under an Open Government License for Thailand, which can be viewed here (In Thai).
Acknowledgements:
The Thai Corpus was developed by the team of students of HSE School of Linguistics in Moscow under the guidance of professor Boris Orekhov. The team consisted of Grigory Ignatyev, Alexandra Ershova, Anna Kuznetsova, Tatyana Shalganova, Daniil Kolomeytsev and Nikolai Mikulin. The consulting help on Thai language was provided by Nadezhda Motina.

Who's the Boss? People with Significant Control,Snapshot of UK Business Ownership Details,Jacob Boysen,8,"Version 1,2017-08-23",business,Other,3 GB,CC0,"2,053 views",243 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/uk-psc,"Context:
The People with significant control (PSC) snapshot is a data snapshot containing the full list of PSC's provided to Companies House. The Prime Minister first put corporate transparency on the international agenda when he chaired the G8 summit in Lough Erne and secured commitment to action, the commitment to enhance corporate transparency in the UK was reaffirmed at London‚Äôs International Anti-Corruption Summit in May 2016. Since then the EU and G20 countries have also agreed to act. The UK is the first country in the G20 to create a public register of this kind.
The UK has high standards of business behaviour and corporate governance. The overwhelming majority of UK companies contribute productively to the UK economy, abide by the law and make a valuable contribution to society. But there are exceptions. Some of the features of the company structure which make it good for business also make it attractive to criminals. Companies can be misused to facilitate a range of criminal activities - from money laundering to tax evasion, corruption to terrorist financing. Sometimes those individuals running companies will not conduct themselves in accordance with the high standards we expect in the UK, posing a risk to other companies and consumers alike.
Information about the ownership and control of UK corporate entities will bring benefits for law enforcement, business, civil society and citizens. By making this information publicly available, free of charge, the government is setting a standard that we are persuading other countries to follow.
Content:
A person of significant control is someone that holds more than 25% of shares or voting rights in a company, has the right to appoint or remove the majority of the board of directors or otherwise exercises significant influence or control. This is a snapshot of data in zipped JSON form, as of Aug 23 2017. Daily updated snapshots and streaming API details can be found here. The People with Significant Control (PSC) register includes information about the individuals who own or control companies including their name, month and year of birth, nationality, and details of their interest in the company. From 30 June 2016, UK companies (except listed companies) and limited liability partnerships (LLPs) need to declare this information when issuing their annual confirmation statement to Companies House.

The US Bureau of Labor Statistics monitors and collects day-to-day information about the market price of raw inputs and finished goods, and publishes regularized statistical assays of this data. The Consumer Price Index and the Producer Price Index are its two most famous products. The former tracks the aggregate dollar price of consumer goods in the United States (things like onions, shovels, and smartphones); the latter (this dataset) tracks the cost of raw inputs to the industries producing those goods (things like raw steel, bulk leather, and processed chemicals).
The US federal government uses this dataset to track inflation. While in the short term the raw dollar value of producer inputs may be volatile, in the long term it will always go up due to inflation --- the slowly decreasing buying power of the US dollar.

Having such a task as predicting the travel time of taxis, it can be insightful to have a deeper look at the underlying street network of the city. Network Analysis can enable us to get insights for why certain taxi trips take longer than others given some basic network properties. Examples for the analysis can be: calculate the shortest path, measure the influence of specific streets on the robustness of the network or find out which streets are key points in the network when it comes to traffic flow.

Measures of SES, which are in decades, allow for a 130 year time-series analysis of the changing position of countries in the global status hierarchy. SES scores are the average of each country‚Äôs income and education ranking and are reported as percentile rankings ranging from 1-99. As such, they can be interpreted similarly to other percentile rankings, such has high school standardized test scores. If country A has an SES score of 55, for example, it indicates that 55 percent of the countries in this dataset have a lower average income and education ranking than country A.

Recommender Click Logs- Sowiport,User behavior for multiple recommender systems,Sohier Dane,8,"Version 1,2017-08-15",,Other,2 GB,Other,"1,969 views",169 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/sohier/recommender-click-logs-sowiport,"This dataset contains 28 million recommendation and click/no click pairs from users of the Sowiport library. From the abstract of the pre-print discussing the dataset:
Stereotype and most-popular recommendations are widely neglected in the research-paper recommender-system and digital-library community. In other domains such as movie recommendations and hotel search, however, these recommendation approaches have proven their effectiveness. We were interested to find out how stereotype and most-popular recommendations would perform in the scenario of a digital library. Therefore, we implemented the two approaches in the recommender system of GESIS‚Äô digital library Sowiport, in cooperation with the recommendations-as-aservice provider Mr. DLib. We measured the effectiveness of most-popular and stereotype recommendations with click-through rate (CTR) based on 28 million delivered recommendations. Most-popular recommendations achieved a CTR of 0.11%, and stereotype recommendations achieved a CTR of 0.124%. Compared to a ‚Äúrandom recommendations‚Äù baseline (CTR 0.12%), and a content-based filtering baseline (CTR 0.145%), the results are discouraging. However, for reasons explained in the paper, we concluded that more research is necessary about the effectiveness of stereotype and most-popular recommendations in digital libraries.

Who Dies? Physics Puzzle Dataset,Who can predict the outcome of a physics puzzle better - human or machine?,Christian Vorhemus,8,"Version 1,2017-06-22","video games
artificial intelligence",CSV,365 MB,CC0,"1,930 views",64 downloads,,,https://www.kaggle.com/christianvorhemus/physicspuzzlewhodies,"The Game
""Who Dies?"" is a simple physics puzzle available for Android. Randomly, a world full of stones, monsters, coil springs, slingshots and other objects is created. The user has to guess, which monster will get hit by a stone or falls of the platform when gravity is turned on. He gets point for every right guess, the more points he collects, the more complex the worlds will get.
The Development
For development, Phaser was used, the game map is a 35x20 grid. Each tile in this grid can contain different blockers or objects.
The Data
Every time a user is playing the game, the position of all objects is recorded as well as the selection the user has made and the final set of monsters who died. The dataset consists of 5 columns: DATETIME is a timestamp of when a user played the game. COMPLEXITY is a parameter that measures the difficulty of the game (1 = easy, 100 = hard). MAP is a JSON array containing 3 arrays: The first array contains immobile foreground objects described by a ""type"" property including x and y coordinates. The following list gives an overview about the the most commonly used types:
The second array contains immobile background objects that don't interact with the game objects and are therefore not relevant. The third array contains movable foreground objects. These could be: monsters (""guys""), balls (""smallball"", ""ball"" and ""bigball"" with or without an initial rotation to the left or right), spring (catapults boxes and balls up in the air but not monsters), box, chain, seesaw, spin, switch and switchwall (if a ball touches a switch, all switchwalls with the same color as the switch change their visibility and become transparent to foreground objects or vice versa). Column ""MONSTERS_SELECTED"" contains all the monsters a player thought will get hit by a ball (ordered by the selection time) ""MONSTERS_HIT"" contains all monsters that were actually killed by balls or fell of the platform (ordered by time)
The Goal
There are several interesting outcomes, for example:
Creating a ML algorithm that is able to correctly predict the outcome of the game (which monster will die)
Creating a ML algorithm that is able to correctly predict which monsters a user will most likely pick
Creating a ML algorithm that is able to create new (better?) game worlds"

The US Bureau of Labor Statistics monitors and collects day-to-day information about the market price of raw inputs and finished goods, and publishes regularized statistical assays of this data. The Consumer Price Index and the Producer Price Index are its two most famous products. The former tracks the aggregate dollar price of consumer goods in the United States (things like onions, shovels, and smartphones); the latter (this dataset) tracks the cost of raw inputs to the industries producing those goods (things like raw steel, bulk leather, and processed chemicals).
The US federal government uses this dataset to track inflation. While in the short term the raw dollar value of producer inputs may be volatile, in the long term it will always go up due to inflation --- the slowly decreasing buying power of the US dollar.

international relations",CSV,105 KB,Other,"2,651 views",290 downloads,2 kernels,,https://www.kaggle.com/umichigan/interstate-wars,"Content
The Correlates of War (COW) Project has utilized a classification of wars that is based upon the status of territorial entities, in particular focusing on those that are classified as members of the interstate system. Wars have been categorized by whether they primarily take place between/among states, between/among a state and a non-state actor, and within states.
Within the COW war typology, an interstate, intrastate, or extrastate war must meet same definitional requirements of all wars in that the war must involve sustained combat, involving organized armed forces, resulting in a minimum of 1,000 battle-related combatant fatalities within a twelve month period. For a state to be considered a war participant, the minimum requirement is that it has to either commit 1,000 troops to the war or suffer 100 battle-related deaths.
When Correlates of War scholars J. David Singer and Melvin Small first extended their study of war to include intrastate wars in Resort to Arms, they established the requisite condition that for a conflict to be a war, it must involve armed forces capable of ‚Äúeffective resistance‚Äù on both sides. They then developed two alternative criteria for defining effective resistance: ‚Äúboth sides had to be initially organized for violent conflict and prepared to resist the attacks of their antagonists, or the weaker side, although initially unprepared, is able to inflict upon the stronger opponents at least five percent of the number of fatalities it sustains.‚Äù The effective resistance criteria were specifically utilized to differentiate wars from massacres, one-sided state killings, or general riots by unorganized individuals.

Measuring the relative location of U.S. Supreme Court justices on an ideological continuum allows us to better understand the politics of the high court. Such measures are an important building blocking of statistical models of the Supreme Court, the separation of powers system, and the judicial hierarchy.

The ""Martin-Quinn"" judicial ideology scores are estimated for every justice serving from the October 1937 term to the present. The measures are estimated using a dynamic item response theory model, allowing judicial ideology to trend smoothly through time. Since the scores are estimated from a probability model, they can be used to form other quantities of interest, such as locating the pivotal ""median"" justice, as all well the location of each case in the policy space.

I saw the Pokemon dataset from Alberto Barradas a few weeks ago and I started tinkering around with it to build my own dataset. My first step was building up some python classes for Pokemon, then for Trainers. For the Pokemon class I implemented the statistic calculation as defined here and battle mechanics as defined here. My goal was to battle all possible combinations of all pokemon trainers, but that quickly proved infeasible. As it turns out, there are over 200,000 TRILLION such combinations, so a simulation like that would take some major computing resources that I do not have. So instead, I thought I'd try battles that actually might exist by scraping Bulbapedia for trainers and what pokemon they have. It was a little hacky and it's not a fully exhaustive list (e.g. some trainer classes like special characters are recorded differently, so I skipped them), but it's still a pretty long list of trainers. I used the name from Bulbapedia to look up the Pokemon in Alberto Barrada's Pokemon dataset for base stats, then used the stat determination calculation from Bulbapedia to fill in the Pokemon's stats. I used TinyDB to store the result. See the code here
Content
The data is structured in a SQLite file with two tables, Trainers and Pokemon. Trainers has a trainerID and trainername; Pokemon has trainerID (foreign key) place (position in Trainer's party), pokename (name of the pokemon) and the following stats/types from the original Pokemon with Stats dataset: ""name"", ""level"", ""type1"", ""type2"", ""hp"", ""maxhp"", ""attack"", ""defense"", ""spatk"", ""spdef"", and ""speed"", most of which should be self explanatory. ""hp"" is the current hp of the pokemon, ""maxhp"" is the hp stat of the pokemon.

A local Vermont/New Hampshire real estate firm is looking into modeling closed prices for houses. This dataset contains features of houses in three towns in Vermont, which make up a sizable chunk of the real estate firm's business.
Content
MLS is the real estate information platform that is publicly available. Features were exported from an MLS web platform. Features include # of baths, # of bedrooms, and # of acres. There are also categorical features, such as town and address.
Hint: Natural language processing techniques that identify and leverage the road that a house is on may improve prediction accuracy.
Acknowledgements
Thank you to AH.
Goal
There is a Train, Validate, and, Test. Can you show a cross validated result that beats 10.0% error in closed price? You can use any measure to train your model - RMSE, RMSLE, etc.; however, the accuracy metric is simply mean percent error!
Please Note: These houses can be uniquely identified on the MLS website, which does also have photos of the houses. Computer Vision techniques that retrieve information from photos on the data are of interest to the company, but are not encouraged for this simple dataset, which serves as a jumping off point for future endeavors as it contains data that is already compiled and understood by the firm."

Overview
This dataset has been produced as part of the The Web of Know-How project
To cite this dataset use: Paolo Pareti, Benoit Testu, Ryutaro Ichise, Ewan Klein and Adam Barker. Integrating Know-How into the Linked Data Cloud. Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management, volume 8876 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pages 385-396. Springer International Publishing (2014) (PDF) (bibtex)
Quickstart: if you want to experiment with the most high-quality data before downloading all the datasets, download the file *9of11_knowhow_wikihow*, and optionally files instruction set entities, Process - Inputs, Process - Outputs, Process - Step Links and wikiHow categories hierarchy.
Data representation based on the PROHOW vocabulary
Data extracted from existing web resources is linked to the original resources using the Open Annotation specification
Data concerning the manual evaluation of this dataset is available here
Data also available from datahub
Available Datasets
Instruction datasets:
Datasets *1of11_knowhow_wikihow* to *9of11_knowhow_wikihow* contain instructions from the wikiHow website. Instructions are allocated in the datasets in order of popularity. This means that the most popular and high-quality instructions are found in 9of11_knowhow_wikihow, while the least popular ones are in dataset 1of11_knowhow_wikihow. These instructions are also classified according to the hierarchy found in wikiHow categories hierarchy. wikiHow instructions are community generated. As a result of this, each task is described by at most one set of instructions, which is usually of high quality thanks to the collective community contributions.
Datasets *10of11_knowhow_snapguide* to *11of11_knowhow_snapguide* contain instructions from the Snapguide website. These instructions are not sorted by their popularity, but they are classified in one of the Snapguide categories. Snapguide instructions are created by single users. As a result of this there might be multiple sets of instructions to achieve the same task; however these instructions on average contain more noise as they are not peer-reviewed.
Links datasets:
The Process - Inputs datasets contain detailed information about the inputs of the sets of instructions, including links to DBpedia resources
The Process - Outputs datasets contains detailed information about the outputs of the sets of instructions, including links to DBpedia resources
The Process - Step Links datasets contains links between different sets of instructions
Other datasets:
The wikiHow categories hierarchy dataset contains information on how the various wikiHow categories are hierarchically structured, and how they relate to the Snapguide categories.
The instruction set entities dataset lists all the top-level entities in a sets of instructions. In other words, all the entities which correspond to the title of a set of instructions.
The wikiHow community links dataset lists the links manually created by the wikiHow community of users that interlink entities belonging to different sets of instructions.
Data Model
The following figure is a simple example of how the PROHOW vocabulary is used in the datasets. Instructions in the dataset can have more complex structures, for example instructions could have multiple methods, steps could have further sub-steps, and complex requirements could be decomposed into sub-requirements.
SPARQL queries
Sample SPARQL queries are available here.

In early 2016, The Washington Post wrote that the Justice Department is ""resuming a controversial practice that allows local police departments to funnel a large portion of assets seized from citizens into their own coffers under federal law.
The ""Equitable Sharing Program"" gives police the option of prosecuting some asset forfeiture cases under federal instead of state law, particularly in instances where local law enforcement officers have a relationship with federal authorities as part of a joint task force. Federal forfeiture policies are more permissive than many state policies, allowing police to keep up to 80 percent of assets they seize."" (link to the full article can be found here).

In New York over 10,000 parole eligible prisoners are denied release every year, and while the consequences of these decisions are costly (at $60,000 annually to incarcerate one individual, and more to incarcerate older individuals with illnesses), the process of how these determinations are made is unclear. Advocates for parole reform argue that parole commissioners too often base their decisions on ""the nature of the crime"" for which the individual was convicted, rather than on that individual's accomplishments and growth while serving a sentence in prison.
The Parole Hearing Data Project is part of a broader body of work that can be found on the Museum of the American Prison's website.
Content
Dataset includes sex, race / ethnicity, housing or interview facility, parole board interview type, and interview decision among other factors. Scraping is up-to-date as of July 2016.

The European Union is a unique economic and political union between twenty-eight countries that together cover much of the continent. It was created in the aftermath of the Second World War to foster economic cooperation and thus avoid conflict. The result was the European Economic Community (EEC), established in 1958, with Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands as its members. What began as an economic union has evolved into an organization spanning policy areas, from climate, environment and health to external relations and security, justice and migration. The 1993 name change from the European Economic Community (EEC) to the European Union (EU) reflected this.
The European Union has delivered more than half a century of peace, stability and prosperity, helped raise living standards and launched a single European currency: the Euro. In 2012, the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for advancing the causes of peace, reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe. The single market is the EU's main economic engine, enabling most goods, services, money and people to move freely.

Since the text data were all about stock or index going up or down, so it would be interesting to know which ID predicts accurate or misleading the others about the market trend.
Is volatility level correlated with intraday trading chat amounts or topic amounts of the day?
Can you tell which is the most popular stock they are observing, and the trend is going up or down?"

I have desk job. A very interesting desk job but nevertheless a desk job. Therefore I started doing sports a while ago and now I can't stop anymore. Like every other Geek I need a gadet for every hobby I have and in this case it was a GPS-Sport-Smartwatch: The vivoactive and the vivoactive HR by Garmin. They also offer a data analysis center and as a data scientist I of course had to export the data and employ some analysis that go beyond bar charts. This dataset is basically the bulk-downloaded-not-cleaned-dataset from the mentioned data center. For those interested: there is a nice github project for bulk downloading from garmin connect: https://github.com/kjkjava/garmin-connect-export. The weather data has to be included by hand.
Content
You can find 155 samples, each one representing one sport activity, mainly from the black forest. There are a lot of useless colmuns, which either contain no data or the same value for every sample. You will have to identify these columns in any case and remove them. The ZIP includes the GPX tracks of all activities and can be used as well. The two devices use different GPS sensors and are from my feeling of different precision and reliability (untested). Additionally, the HR device had a lot connectivity problems since summer 2017. The devices lost the signal during a numerous amount of runs and therefore the distance value is not always correct. Usually the start and end timestamps are correct (except for one case) and the GPX files might help to figure out which track I was using. With a single exception all start and ending points are the same in all tracks. This means I started and ended recording at the same cross-roads, not exactly the same position. If you decide to open the GPX files in a GIS, you should be able to repair the affected datasets. I did this using QGIS. You will find one instance with two activities on a single day. This is actually the same activity, where I went to the peak of Rosskopf in the Black Forest. Because my brain was undersupplied after runnning up there I ended the activity instead of pausing it, that's why I ended up with two activities, that have to be merged together.
Soft data
For the dataset, there is also some soft data which might be helpful:
I commute 130 km to work since June 2016, usually on Mon, Tue, Wed. Possibly, I spent less time on sports since then on these days.
I wrote my Master thesis from Sep / 2015 until Mar 2016. Maybe I was doing more sports during the thesis (except for the last two weeks?)
Since I commute, I would say I do sports less frequently, but on longer distances and over higher elevation gains
I bought new shoes in August 2016, which are WAY more comfortable

The bulk downloading script for garmin connect was really helpful: https://github.com/kjkjava/garmin-connect-export. Without this tool I most likely would not have created this dataset.

I am personally very interested if my running performance is dependent on specific weather conditions and eventually predictable. Another interesting thing would be to see how other people rate the performance based on the given data. I use this dataset also during my teaching in a Python and a statistics class at University. I decided to upload the data and some of my teaching notebooks to Kaggle (in the near future) in oder to give my students access to external comments on my kernels, givem them the opportunity to upload their solutions to a bigger community and eventually scan your kernels on the data."

Missing people, especially kids, is a serious problem. However there is not much detailed information about it. Russian officials provide overall information without detalisation of victim's age. As a result many speculations appear in media on this topic:
Last year about 200,000 reports of missing people were filed with police in Russia.
45,000 kids lost every year
More than 15,000 kids lost every year
Radio interview - starting from minute 7:55 main point: ""More than 15K kids lost completely, i.e. was not ever found""
Some insights to official data can be found here interview, year 2012: ""Annually in Russia about 20 thousand minors disappear, in 90% of cases the police find children"".
Still there is no information about kids in recent years. If you have any reliable sources, please share."

In Lithuania, Lithuanian Parliament has sittings several times per week, during each sitting member of parliament vote for proposed questions. Some questions are related to law amendments other questions could be something like ""should we do a break before taking more questions"". In one they there can be several sittings, usually one in the morning and another in the evening.
All members of parliament (MPs) form parliamentary groups, there is a group having majority of MS's and other smaller groups.
In this dataset you will find all votes made by all MPs since 1997 up until 2017. So that is a lot of data and basically most of the political history of independent Lithuania.

Each row in votes.csv file represents a vote mode by single MP on a single question. Also for each vote there is a number of meta data provided:
voting_id - unique voting id, can be a negative number. You can reconstruct URL to the voting page using this template: http://www.lrs.lt/sip/portal.show?p_r=15275&p_k=1&p_a=sale_bals&p_bals_id={voting_id}, replace {voting_id} with a voting id.
voter_id - unique MP id.
time - date and time when a vote was cast.
group - abbreviated name of a parliamentary group.
voter - full name of an MP.
question - question text, usually question sounds like ""do we accept this proposal or not"", unfortunately title and texts of proposed documents are not included in this dataset.
sitting_type - one of:
rytinis - in the morning
vakarinis - in the evening
neeilinis - additional sitting
nenumatytas - not planned
vote - vote value, one of:
1 - aye
-0.5 - abstain
-1 - against
n_eligible_voters - total number of eligible to vote MPs.
n_eligible_voters - number of MPs who voted in a voting.

One of the most interesting questions I would like to get is a way to automatically categorize all the voting by topic. Usually there are several major topics involving multiple documents and many voting sessions, some times these topics can last for years. Unfortunately there is no such field, with a topic, in order to discover a topic one would need to analyze content of documents and probably sitting transcripts to find a topic. But in order to do this, data of documents and sitting transcripts will be needed, I will provide this data some time later.
Other interesting things to look into is how different parliamentary groups or people relates to one another by their votes."

League of Legends Summoner Ids and Data - 2016,480k summoner ids sorted by tier from October 2016. Game data from 130k players.,Chris Pierse,7,"Version 1,2017-04-27",video games,CSV,111 MB,CC4,"2,193 views",201 downloads,2 kernels,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/xenogearcap/league2016,"Context
The summoner ids, which are unique to each player, were collected and sorted by ranked tier around October of last year. The game data was collected from only gold-ranked summoner ids.
I originally collected this data to identify which champions top Quinn mains tend to play aside from Quinn. The strongest correlation I found was that top Quinn players tend to also play Graves in the top lane. I recently revisited this project to put together a simple recommender system with newer data, and that system can be found here.
I am sharing the 2016 data here because Riot's API seems to only provide a summoner's current rank, i.e. there is no rank history. This 2016 data could be useful for anyone interested in seeing how summoners have evolved over time. To get you started on working with champion data, I also added the 2016 game data I collected from Gold-ranked summoners when I was investigating top Quinn players.
Content
All data was collected through Riot Games' publicly available API.
SummIds2016 - 480421 summoner ids sorted by tier as of late October 2016.
GoldSummData2016 - Game data from 131552 Gold-ranked summoners. For each summoner, all champions that were played in the 2016 season at the time of collection are presented and sorted by role. The roles are those provided by Riot's API. The columns are separated by commas, while the champions in each role are separated by spaces.
ChampId2Name - Maps champion ids to champion names.
Acknowledgements
This data is only available because Riot provides a publicly accessible API. Thanks Riot! The banner image is also the property of Riot Games.
Inspiration
Given that the unique aspect of this data set is the rank of each summoner in 2016, it would be interesting to see how many summoners improved their performance from 2016 to 2017. Perhaps you can identify an underlying trend that can explain why some summoner's went up/down in rank, e.g. top Quinn players may have increased in rank due to the buffs to lethality.
Because League of Legends changes with each patch, it would also be interesting to see how someone can leverage year-old data to make recommendations that are still relevant."

Beginning in 2009, the frequency of earthquakes in the U.S. State of Oklahoma rapidly increased from an average of fewer than two 3.0+ magnitude earthquakes per year since 1978 to hundreds per year in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Thousands of earthquakes have occurred in Oklahoma and surrounding areas in southern Kansas and North Texas since 2009. Scientific studies attribute the rise in earthquakes to the disposal of wastewater produced during oil extraction that has been injected deeply into the ground. (Wikipedia)
Injection wells are utilized to dispose of fluid created as a byproduct of oil and gas production activities. Likewise, hydraulic fracturing, ie ""fracking"", produces large byproducts of water. This byproduct is then injected deep back into the earth via disposal/injection wells.

This dataset contains two data files. One detailing ""active"" saltwater injection wells in Oklahoma, as of September 2017. The second file lists earthquakes in the Oklahoma region (Oklahoma and surrounding states) since 1977.

Gas sensor array under dynamic gas mixtures,"Time series data for Ethylene and Methane in air, and Ethylene and CO in air",UCI Machine Learning,7,"Version 2,2017-11-02|Version 1,2017-10-12",time series,Other,2 GB,ODbL,"1,087 views",84 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/gas-sensor-array-under-dynamic-gas-mixtures,"Context
This data set contains the acquired time series from 16 chemical sensors exposed to gas mixtures at varying concentration levels. In particular, we generated two gas mixtures: Ethylene and Methane in air, and Ethylene and CO in air. Each measurement was constructed by the continuous acquisition of the 16-sensor array signals for a duration of about 12 hours without interruption.
The data set was collected in a gas delivery platform facility at the ChemoSignals Laboratory in the BioCircuits Institute, University of California San Diego. The measurement system platform provides versatility for obtaining the desired concentrations of the chemical substances of interest with high accuracy and in a highly reproducible manner.
The sensor array included 16 chemical sensors (Figaro Inc., US) of 4 different types: TGS-2600, TGS-2602, TGS-2610, TGS-2620 (4 units of each type). The sensors were integrated with customized signal conditioning and control electronics. The operating voltage of the sensors, which controls the sensors√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ operating temperature, was kept constant at 5 V for the whole duration of the experiments. The sensors√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ conductivities were acquired continuously at a sampling frequency of 100 Hz. The sensor array was placed in a 60 ml measurement chamber, where the gas sample was injected at a constant flow of 300 ml/min.
Each measurement was constructed by the continuous acquisition of the 16-sensor array signals while concentration levels changed randomly. For each measurement (each gas mixture), the signals were acquired continuously for about 12 hours without interruption.
The concentration transitions were set at random times (in the interval 80-120s) and to random concentration levels. The data set was constructed such that all possible transitions are present: increasing, decreasing, or setting to zero the concentration of one volatile while the concentration of the other volatile is kept constant (either at a fixed or at zero concentration level). At the beginning, ending, and approximately every 10,000 s, we inserted additional predefined concentration patterns with pure gas mixtures.
The concentration ranges for Ethylene, Methane, and CO were selected such that the induced magnitudes of the sensor responses were similar. Moreover, for gas mixtures, lower concentration levels were favored. Therefore, the multivariate response of the sensors to the presented set of stimuli is challenging since none of the configurations (single gas or mixture presentation) can be easily identified from the magnitude of sensors√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ responses. In particular Ethylene concentration ranges from 0-20 ppm; 0-600 ppm for CO; and 0-300 ppm for Methane.
The primary purpose of making this data set freely accessible on-line is to provide extensive and continuous time series acquired from chemical sensors to the sensor and artificial intelligence research communities to develop and test strategies to solve a wide variety of tasks. In particular, the data set may be useful to develop algorithms for continuous monitoring or improve response time of sensory systems. Also, the repetition of the same type of sensors in the array will allow further investigation on sensor variability (reproducibility of sensors of the same kind). Other interesting topics may include sensor failure (to what extent system predictions degrade when sensors start failing) or calibration transfer (whether the model for one sensor can be extended to other sensors).
More information on the generated data set can be found in Fonollosa et al. 'Reservoir Computing compensates slow response of chemosensor arrays exposed to fast varying gas concentrations in continuous monitoring'; Sensors and Actuators B, 2015.
The data set can be used exclusively for research purposes. Commercial purposes are fully excluded.
Content
The data is presented in two different files: Each file contains the data from one mixture. The file ethylene_CO.txt contains the recordings from the sensors when exposed to mixtures of Ethylene and CO in air. The file ethylene_methane.txt contains the acquired time series induced by the mixture of Methane and Ethylene in air.
The structure of the files is the same: Data is distributed in 19 columns. First column represents time (in seconds), second column represents Methane (or CO) concentration set point (in ppm), third column details Ethylene concentration set point (in ppm), and the following 16 columns show the recordings of the sensor array.
Files include a header (one line) with the information of each column:
Time (seconds), Methane conc (ppm), Ethylene conc (ppm), sensor readings (16 channels)
The order of the sensors in the files is as follows: TGS2602; TGS2602; TGS2600; TGS2600; TGS2610; TGS2610; TGS2620; TGS2620; TGS2602; TGS2602; TGS2600; TGS2600; TGS2610; TGS2610; TGS2620; TGS2620

Matrices with intermediate results
Following matrices with intermediate results are provided:
accuracy_matrix.csv - matrix with number of correctly classified images for each pair of attack (targeted and non-targeted) and defense
error_matrix.csv - matrix with number of misclassified images for each pair of attack (targeted and non-targeted) and defense
hit_target_class_matrix.csv - matrix with number of times image was classified as specific target class for each pair of attack (targeted and non-targeted) and defense
In each of these matrices, rows correspond to defenses, columns correspond to attack. Also first row and column are headers with Kaggle Team IDs (or baseline ID).
Scores and run time statistics of submissions
Following files contain scores and run time stats of the submissions:
non_targeted_attack_results.csv - scores and run time statistics of all non-targeted attacks
targeted_attack_results.csv - scores and run time statistics of all targeted attacks
defense_results.csv - scores and run time statistics of all defenses
Each row of these files correspond to one submission. Columns have following meaning:
KaggleTeamId - either Kaggle Team ID or ID of the baseline.
TeamName - human readable team name
Score - raw score of the submission
NormalizedScore - normalized (to be between 0 and 1) score of the submission
MinEvalTime - minimum evaluation time of 100 images
MaxEvalTime - maximum evaluation time of 100 images
MedianEvalTime - median evaluation time of 100 images
MeanEvalTime - average evaluation time of 100 images
Notes about the data
Due to team mergers, team name in these files might be different from the leaderboard.
Not all attacks were used to compute scores of defenses and not all defenses were used to compute scores of attacks. Thus if you simply sum-up values in rows/columns of the corresponding matrix you won't obtain exact score of the submission (however number you obtain will be very close to actual score)."

This selection of images are controls selected from a screen to find novel anti-infectives using the roundworm C.elegans . The animals were exposed to the pathogen Enterococcus faecalis and either untreated or treated with ampicillin, a known antibiotic against the pathogen. The untreated (negative control) worms display predominantly the ""dead"" phenotype: worms appear rod-like in shape and slightly uneven in texture. The treated (ampicillin, positive control) worms display predominantly the ""live"" phenotype: worms appear curved in shape and smooth in texture. For more information, please see Moy et al. (ACS Chem Biol, 2009) [http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/cb900084v]
Images
One image per channel (Channel 1 = brightfield; channel 2 = GFP) was acquired at MGH on a Discovery-1 automated microscope (Molecular Devices). Original image size is 696 x 520 pixels. Images are available in 16-bit TIF.
Ground Truth
The 384 images are from a plate of positive and negative controls. The images are named using this format: <plate>_<wellrow>_<wellcolumn>_<wavelength>_<fileid>.tif Columns 1-12 are positive controls treated with ampicillin. Columns 13-24 are untreated negative controls.
We also provide human-corrected binary images of foreground/background segmentation. To address the problem of correctly segmenting individual worms also when they overlap or cluster, we provide one binary foreground/background segmentation ground truth image for each worm:

COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) is a popular commercial algorithm used by judges and parole officers for scoring criminal defendant‚Äôs likelihood of reoffending (recidivism). It has been shown that the algorithm is biased in favor of white defendants, and against black inmates, based on a 2 year follow up study (i.e who actually committed crimes or violent crimes after 2 years). The pattern of mistakes, as measured by precision/sensitivity is notable.
Quoting from ProPublica: ""
Black defendants were often predicted to be at a higher risk of recidivism than they actually were. Our analysis found that black defendants who did not recidivate over a two-year period were nearly twice as likely to be misclassified as higher risk compared to their white counterparts (45 percent vs. 23 percent). White defendants were often predicted to be less risky than they were. Our analysis found that white defendants who re-offended within the next two years were mistakenly labeled low risk almost twice as often as black re-offenders (48 percent vs. 28 percent). The analysis also showed that even when controlling for prior crimes, future recidivism, age, and gender, black defendants were 45 percent more likely to be assigned higher risk scores than white defendants.
Black defendants were also twice as likely as white defendants to be misclassified as being a higher risk of violent recidivism. And white violent recidivists were 63 percent more likely to have been misclassified as a low risk of violent recidivism, compared with black violent recidivists.
The violent recidivism analysis also showed that even when controlling for prior crimes, future recidivism, age, and gender, black defendants were 77 percent more likely to be assigned higher risk scores than white defendants. ""
Content
Data contains variables used by the COMPAS algorithm in scoring defendants, along with their outcomes within 2 years of the decision, for over 10,000 criminal defendants in Broward County, Florida. 3 subsets of the data are provided, including a subset of only violent recividism (as opposed to, e.g. being reincarcerated for non violent offenses such as vagrancy or Marijuana).

Reweighting data to compensate for bias, e.g. subsetting for the violent offenders, or adjusting better for base risk.

The following is the results of an online survey conducted by BoilingSteam.com among the Linux Gamers' Community (n=560, sharing only here answers where respondents explicitly agreed to have their answers made public, i.e. total n size was higher) in end of Q1 2016, to better understand their hardware, usage habits and reactions to several of Valve's Steam Initiatives. Most of the answers are coming from members of the r/Linux_Gaming and r/Linux subreddits, so you need to take in account that this may not be representative of your typical Linux user.
Content
There are many variables in this data set, with both numerical, free text and categorical answers. Every line corresponds to an individual response. Note that answers are anonymous. The first row is the coding you can use for your analysis (that should save a bit of time), the second row is the actual question asked (you can erase it), and the data starts from the third row.
Questions cover some of the following attributes (there are much more in the actual datasheet):
Demographics / Geography

College presidents across the nation recognized a need to track how student-athletes are doing academically prior to graduation. Starting in 2003, colleges and universities in NCAA Division I ‚Äî the largest and highest profile athletics programs ‚Äî implemented a comprehensive academic reform package designed to improve the academic success and graduation of all student-athletes. The centerpiece of the academic reform package was the development of a real-time academic measurement for sports teams, known as the Academic Progress Rate (APR).
The APR includes student-athlete eligibility, retention and graduation as factors in a formula that yields a single number, providing a much clearer picture of the current academic culture on each Division I sports team in the country. Since its inception, the APR has become an important measure of student-athlete academic success. For high APR scores, the NCAA recognizes member institutions for ensuring that student-athletes succeed in the classroom. If, however, low APR scores are earned consistently, member institutions can be subjected to penalties including scholarship reductions and the loss of eligibility to compete in championships.
Content

Abraham Lincoln's election produced Southern secession, war, and abolition. This dataset was used to study connections between news and slave prices for the period 1856-1861. By August 1861, slave prices had declined by roughly one-third from their 1860 peak. That decline was similar for all age and sex cohorts and thus did not reflect expected emancipation without compensation. The decision to secede reflected beliefs that the North would not invade and that emancipation without compensation was unlikely. Both were encouraged by Lincoln's conciliatory tone before the attack on Fort Sumter, and subsequently dashed by Lincoln's willingness to wage all-out war.

Fine-grained Context-sensitive Lexical Inference,Annotations for semantic relations between words within context sentences,Vered Shwartz,7,"Version 1,2017-08-12",,CSV,3 MB,GPL,571 views,31 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/vered1986/context-lexinf,"Context
Recognizing lexical inference is an essential component in natural language understanding. In question answering, for instance, identifying that broadcast and air are synonymous enables answering the question ""When was 'Friends' first aired?"" given the text ""'Friends' was first broadcast in 1994"". Semantic relations such as synonymy (tall, high) and hypernymy (cat, pet) are used to infer the meaning of one term from another, in order to overcome lexical variability. This inference should typically be performed within a given context, considering both the term meanings in context and the specific semantic relation that holds between the terms.
Content
This dataset provides annotations for fine-grained lexical inferences in-context. The dataset consists of 3,750 term pairs, each given within a context sentence, built upon a subset of terms from PPDB. Each term pair is annotated to the semantic relation that holds between the terms in the given contexts.
Files:
full_dataset.csv - the full dataset is provided, as well as the train-test-validation split.
train.csv, test.csv, validation.csv - A split of the dataset to 70% train, 25% test, and 5% validation sets. Each of the sets contains different term-pairs, to avoid overfitting for the most common relation of a term-pair in the training set.
File Structure: comma-separated file
Fields:
x: the first term
y: the second term
context_x: the sentence in which x appears (highlighted by x)
context_y: the sentence in which y appears (highlighted by y)
semantic_relation: the (directional) semantic relation that holds between x and y: equivalence, forward_entailment, reverse_entailment, alternation, other-related and independence.
confidence: the relation annotation confidence (percentage of annotators that selected this relation), in a scale of 0-1

To meet the globalization challenges raising higher education quality to the world standard is essential. Bangladesh Govt. has taken initiatives to develop the quality of tertiary education. Govt. plans to prepare university graduates in such way that they can successfully compete in the context of international knowledge society.
Accordingly, the Ministry of Education, with the assistance of the World Bank, has undertaken a Higher Education Quality Enhancement Project (HEQEP). The project aims at improving the quality of teaching-learning and research capabilities of the tertiary education institutions through encouraging both innovation and accountability and by enhancing the technical and institutional capacity of the higher education sector.
The University Grants Commission of Bangladesh is the implementing agency of the project. A HEQEP Unit has been established in UGC for implementation, management, monitoring and evaluation of the activities.
The Data set contains 500 rows and they are Timestamped showing the exact time of data collection process. The survey was conducted on Undergraduate and Postgraduate level students of a Bangladeshi Private University. Among the various columns of data, the GPA columns contains important linear data with strong correlation. These data can be used to predict other GPA columns. So that we can predict a student's GPA in advance and can take necessary steps to improve his or her score.
Some acronyms that might help understand the Data set: S.S.C- Secondary School Certificate ( 10th Class public exam) H.S.C- Higher Secondary School Certificate ( 12th Class public exam) Area of Evaluation - There are 1 to 5 points. Where 5 being the best and 1 being the worst.

The ability to monitor species in their natural habitat is useful when determining how the species respond to changes in environment. This may be particularly important when the species being studied are endangered and a population decline will trigger management action. The Eastern Ground Parrot (Pezoporous wallicus wallicus) is found only in Australia, where it is officially listed as a rare and threatened species. Furthermore, it is difficult to directly observe, as it lives in dense vegetation and rarely flies. As such, the chance of successful monitoring depends on locating the vocalisation or calls. One of the techniques that has been commonly used to monitor Ground Parrots (GPs) in their natural habitat is for experienced ecologists to listen to the calls and manually locate and plot the perceived distribution of the birds. More recently, surveys have also used techniques based on audio signal processing and pattern recognition, where records of acoustic signals are analysed and specific vocalisations are detected. Such detection can be used for the purpose of recognition and estimation of the number of GPs in the habitat.
To facilitate research on bird call detection using pattern recognition techniques, we provide here a dataset of GP vocalisation. The dataset contains 4 audio sequences of different lengths sampled at 16kHz using Song Meter SM2 devices. The dataset was recorded at dusk and dawn times on different days and at four different locations in the Barren Grounds Nature Reserve, a protected nature park located in the Southern Highlands region of New South Wales, Australia. The sequences include overlapping GP calls and sounds from sources other than GP (e.g. wind, spurious noise, and vocalisations of other species). All the GP calls in the dataset are manually annotated and used as the ground truth for evaluation of detection algorithms.

Discourse acts are the different types of things you can do in a conversation, like agreeing, disagreeing or elaborating. This dataset contains annotations of the discourse acts of different Twitter comments. The discourse acts labeled here are ‚Äúcoarse‚Äù in the sense that they‚Äôre labelled broadly (for the whole Reddit comment) rather than for individual sentences or phrases, not in the sense of being vulgar. The discourse act of each post has been annotated by multiple annotators.

Data sampling and pre-processing
Selecting Reddit threads
This data was randomly sampled from the full Reddit dataset starting from its inception to the end of May 2016, which is made available publicly as a dump on Google BigQuery. This dataset was subsampled from the larger dataset and does not include posts with fewer than two comments, not in English, which contain pornographic material or from Subreddits focused on trading. Further, the number of replies to a single thread was limited to 40.
Annotation
Three annotators were assigned to each thread and were instructed to annotate each comment in the thread with its discourse act (main_type) as well as the relation of each comment to a prior comment (link_to_post), if it existed. Annotators were instructed to consider the content at the comment level as opposed to sentence or paragraph level to make the task simpler.

The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project is designed for disaggregated conflict analysis and crisis mapping. This dataset codes the dates and locations of all reported political violence and protest events in dozens of developing countries in Africa. Political violence and protest includes events that occur within civil wars and periods of instability, public protest and regime breakdown. The project covers all African countries from 1997 to the present.
Content:
These data contain information on:
Dates and locations of conflict events;
Specific types of events including battles, civilian killings, riots, protests and recruitment activities;
Events by a range of actors, including rebels, governments, militias, armed groups, protesters and civilians;

KCBS Barbeque Competitions,"Competition context and results from 1,559 KCBS Barbeque Competitions",73805,7,"Version 2,2017-07-21|Version 1,2017-07-20",food and drink,CSV,11 MB,CC0,"1,776 views",139 downloads,3 kernels,,https://www.kaggle.com/jaysobel/kcbs-bbq,"Context
This data set is the aggregate of 1,559 KCBS competitions from July 2013 through December 2016. The Kansas City Barbeque Society (KCBS) is ""world's largest organization of barbeque and grilling enthusiasts with over 20,000 members worldwide."" The data set was constructed by scraping the KCBS events page
A Standard Competition
At a standard KCBS BBQ Competition, 30 certified barbeque judges (CBJs) blindly judge the BBQ served by 36 teams. Judges are broken up into tables of 6. There are four categories of meat: chicken, pork ribs, pork and brisket. Each judge receives six samples representing six different teams.
Scoring
Samples are scored across three characteristics: appearance, taste and tenderness. Scores range from 0 to 9, with a 9 being perfect, a 6 corresponding to average, and a 0 given as part of a DQ or other official sanction. A team's score within a category is calculated by a weighted sum of the six judges' scores. The KCBS scoring weights were last changed in July 2013 which aligns with the start date of this data set. The maximum score in a category is 180 (9 points * 3 characteristics * 6 judges). The maximum overall score in a standard 4-category competition is 720 (180 points * 4 categories). Not all competitions in this data set are standard 4-category; see the is_standard feature.
Content
Competition Data Features:
This CSV file contains 1,559 rows of competition data. Scoring and placing resultsare stored separately across five category-specific files. The scoring results are linked to their competitions by a foreign key. There are many results for each competition in this file.
contest_key - the primary key used to link rows of results to a competition
date - the date of the competition
title - the name of the competition
location_str - the full string of the location ie New Palestine, IN
city - the city extracted from location_str
state - the state abbreviation extracted from location_str
state_full - the full name of the state extrapolated from state
prize - the total prize money awarded (I believe it's total, and not just 1st place)
cbj_percentage - the percentage of judges that are certified barbeque judges (CBJs)
is_championsip - a boolean indicating if the competition is a ""state championship"" (note: each state has more than one per year)
is_standard - a boolean indicating if the competition consists of and only of the four categories: chicken, pork ribs, pork and brisket. Some competitions include extra categories like dessert and these are considered non-standard (note: overall scores in a non-standard competition may be greater that 4 * 180)
Results Data Features:
There are five separate tables of results; one for each of the standard categories. The features are the same across each of these tables.
contest_key - the foreign key linking a result row to its competition
place - the place earned by a competing team (1st 2nd 3rd as 1, 2, 3)
score - the total score (0-180 in a chicken, ribs, pork and brisket, 0-720 in overall-- assuming a standard competition)
team_name - the name of the team (usually clever, and good for a word cloud!)
Acknowledgements
I'd like to thank the KCBS for providing fun opportunities to taste great BBQ, and recording event data on the website in an fairly accessible and light-weight manner. In the future I'd love to experiment with anonymized judge scoring data. A judge can view their scoring history and how it compared sample-by-sample with other judges' scores at the table.

The Rajya Sabha has published the questions and answers that were discussed in each session on their webiste. But one has to search by question/session/ministry wise to get the detail. There were no direct way to get all the quesions and answers in structured way(i.e, csv) to do an analysis and find insights.

""Tate is an institution that houses the United Kingdom's national collection of British art, and international modern and contemporary art. It is a network of four art museums: Tate Britain, London (until 2000 known as the Tate Gallery, founded 1897), Tate Liverpool (founded 1988), Tate St Ives, Cornwall (founded 1993) and Tate Modern, London (founded 2000), with a complementary website, Tate Online (created 1998). Tate is not a government institution, but its main sponsor is the UK Department for Culture, Media and Sport.
""The name 'Tate' is used also as the operating name for the corporate body, which was established by the Museums and Galleries Act 1992 as 'The Board of Trustees of the Tate Gallery'.
""The gallery was founded in 1897, as the National Gallery of British Art. When its role was changed to include the national collection of modern art as well as the national collection of British art, in 1932, it was renamed the Tate Gallery after sugar magnate Henry Tate of Tate & Lyle, who had laid the foundations for the collection. The Tate Gallery was housed in the current building occupied by Tate Britain, which is situated in Millbank, London. In 2000, the Tate Gallery transformed itself into the current-day Tate, or the Tate Modern, which consists of a federation of four museums: Tate Britain, which displays the collection of British art from 1500 to the present day; Tate Modern, which is also in London, houses the Tate's collection of British and international modern and contemporary art from 1900 to the present day. Tate Liverpool has the same purpose as Tate Modern but on a smaller scale, and Tate St Ives displays modern and contemporary art by artists who have connections with the area. All four museums share the Tate Collection. One of the Tate's most publicised art events is the awarding of the annual Turner Prize, which takes place at Tate Britain.""

Prop. E was a measure on the November 8, 2016 San Francisco ballot regarding responsibility for maintaining street trees and surrounding sidewalks. Voters were asked if the City should amend the City Charter to transfer responsibility from property owners to the City for maintaining trees on sidewalks adjacent to their property, as well for repairing sidewalks damaged by the trees. Prop E passed with almost 80% of the voters‚Äô support. As part of this proposition, a SF tree census was conducted by SF Public Works.

This dataset summarizes valuable data about recent total solar power generation and total electricity demand in a specific european country like Italy. Data are time series with hourly resolution, and values represent average of real-time power (generated and used) per market time unit (*). Data correspond to years 2015 and 2016. They are useful to analyze, for instance, the variation of solar generation with time in the four seasons of the year, the change of electricity demand depending on the day of the week, or in summer/winter holidays. Use of historical weather data could help to visualize the variation of solar power generation with climate conditions, extremely useful excercise for solar power generation forecasting. Studies of load forecasting could be also conducted by making use of the present dataset.
(*) Detailed data descriptions
Content
The two files include time series data of solar generation and total electricity consumption in Italy during the years 2015 and 2016, with hourly resolution. CSV files are structured in three columns: 1. Date and Time 2. Load 3. Solar Generation The time is expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and the format of Date and Time is ""%Y-%m-%dT%H%M%SZ"". Solar generation and load are floating point numbers, which represent power expressed in MW (Mega Watts) units. Solar generation is the total solar power generated in Italy in 2015 and 2016, calculated by adding the generation in the different italian bidding zones (6 geographical regions: Nord, Centro Nord, Centro Sud, Sud, Sardegna and Sicilia, and 4 poles: Brindisi, Foggia, Priolo and Rossano). Load represents the total demand of power in the same periods. Note: the 2015 file presents a few missing data.

This dataset comes from research by Semeion, Research Center of Sciences of Communication. The original aim of the research was to correctly classify the type of surface defects in stainless steel plates, with six types of possible defects (plus ""other""). The Input vector was made up of 27 indicators that approximately [describe] the geometric shape of the defect and its outline. According to the research paper, Semeion was commissioned by the Centro Sviluppo Materiali (Italy) for this task and therefore it is not possible to provide details on the nature of the 27 indicators used as Input vectors or the types of the 6 classes of defects.

The data reflects violations that occurred from July 1, 2014 until present, minus the most recent 14 days. This data may change due to occasional time lags between the capturing of a potential violation and the processing and determination of a violation. The most recent 14 days are not shown due to revised data being submitted to the City of Chicago during this period. The reported violations are those that have been collected by the camera system and reviewed by two separate City contractors. In some instances, due to the inability the registered owner of the offending vehicle, the violation may not be issued as a citation. However, this dataset contains all violations regardless of whether a citation was actually issued, which provides an accurate view into the Red Light Program. Because of occasional time lags between the capturing of a potential violation and the processing and determination of a violation, as well as the occasional revision of the determination of a violation, this data may change.

Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition
Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity.
An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers.
The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.

What is a Pre-trained Model?
A pre-trained model has been previously trained on a dataset and contains the weights and biases that represent the features of whichever dataset it was trained on. Learned features are often transferable to different data. For example, a model trained on a large dataset of bird images will contain learned features like edges or horizontal lines that you would be transferable your dataset.
Why use a Pre-trained Model?
Pre-trained models are beneficial to us for many reasons. By using a pre-trained model you are saving time. Someone else has already spent the time and compute resources to learn a lot of features and your model will likely benefit from it."

This dataset contains chat messages from Dota 2 ‚Äî video game by Valve, one of the most popular eSport discipline. The dataset was used to train Roflan bot. It contains chats of almost 1M matches from public matchmaking (when players are selected by the game server at random with about the same skill level).
Caution and Disclaimer
Important, please read. This dataset is completely Not Safe For Work.
In Dota 2 the players communicate with each other in a very specific way. For instance, you may found a lot of abbreviations and game-specific terms. For Dota 2 player it is typical to blame teammates and opponents for failure in the game. Unfortunately, many messages may contain coarse insults, humiliation of another player's family, expressions of racism and other awful things. We provide the messages ""as is"" without any filters and censorship and we are not responsible for offensive content inside the data.
Our goal is to give researchers an opportunity to explore players community by diving into a real dialogs. We want to draw an attention to the problem of outstanding toxicity of the most Dota 2 players, we consider this behaviour of players unhealthy.
Usage of the dataset
See rough explanations on how do we learn our Roflan bot intended to mirror typical player's chat behaviour. You can apply your own language models on this dataset and make alternative chat bot or just compare performance of learning.
Look at this arXiv paper with analysis of esport spectators' chats. You can apply similar analysis to game participants chats."

Cargo 2000 is an initiative of IATA, the International Air Transport Association (Cargo 2000 has been re-branded as Cargo iQ in 2016). It aims at delivering a new quality management system for the air cargo industry. Cargo 2000 allows for unprecedented transparency in the supply chain. Stakeholders involved in the transport process can share agreed Cargo 2000 messages, comprising transport planning, replanning and service completion events. Cargo 2000 is based on the following key principles: (1) Every shipment gets a plan (called a route map) describing predefined monitoring events. (2) Every service used during shipment is assigned a predefined milestone with a planned time of achievement.

The case study data comprises tracking and tracing events from a forwarding company‚Äôs Cargo 2000 system for a period of five months. From those Cargo 2000 messages, we reconstructed execution traces of 3,942 actual business process instances, comprising 7,932 transport legs and 56,082 service invocations. Each execution trace includes planned and effective durations (in minutes) for each of the services of the business process (introduced in Section II), as well as airport codes for the DEP (‚Äúdeparture‚Äù) and RCF (‚Äúarrival‚Äù) services. Due to the fact that handling of transport documents along the business process differs based on whether the documents are paper-based or electronic, we focus on the flow of physical goods, as our data set did not allow us to discern the different document types.
The reconstruction process involved data sanitation and anonymization. We filtered overlapping and incomplete Cargo 2000 messages, removed canceled transports (i.e., deleted route maps), sanitized for exceptions from the C2K system (such as events occurring before route map creation) and homogenized the way information was represented in different message types. Finally, due to confidentiality reasons, message fields which might exhibit business critical or customer-related data (such as airway bill numbers, flight numbers and airport codes) have been eliminated or masked.
Each of the transport legs involves the following physical transport services:
‚Ä¢ RCS: Check in freight at departure airline. Shipment is checked in and a receipt is produced at departure airport.
‚Ä¢ DEP: Confirm goods on board. Aircraft has departed with shipment on board.
‚Ä¢ RCF: Accept freight at arrival airline. Shipment is checked in according to the documents and stored at arrival warehouse.
‚Ä¢ DLV: Deliver freight. Receipt of shipment was signed at destination airport.

The Ramen Rater is a product review website for the hardcore ramen enthusiast (or ""ramenphile""), with over 2500 reviews to date. This dataset is an export of ""The Big List"" (of reviews), converted to a CSV format.
Content
Each record in the dataset is a single ramen product review. Review numbers are contiguous: more recently reviewed ramen varieties have higher numbers. Brand, Variety (the product name), Country, and Style (Cup? Bowl? Tray?) are pretty self-explanatory. Stars indicate the ramen quality, as assessed by the reviewer, on a 5-point scale; this is the most important column in the dataset!
Note that this dataset does not include the text of the reviews themselves. For that, you should browse through https://www.theramenrater.com/ instead!

Marijuana may get a bad rep in the media as far as the decriminalization debate goes, but its health benefits can no longer go unnoticed. With various studies linking long-term marijuana use to positive, health-related effects, there are more than just a few reasons to smoke some weed every day.
A study done by the Boston Medical Center and the Boston University of Medicine, examined 589 drug users‚Äîmore than 8 out of 10 of whom were pot smokers. It determined that ‚Äúweed aficionados‚Äù were no more likely to visit the doctor than non-drug users. If an increased risk of contracting ailments is what‚Äôs preventing you from smoking more weed, it looks like you‚Äôre in the clear!
One of the greatest medicinal benefits of marijuana is its pain relieving qualities, which make it especially effective for treating chronic pain. From menstruation cramps to nerve pain, as little as three puffs of bud a day can help provide the same relief as synthetic painkillers. Marijuana relieves pain by ‚Äúchanging the way the nerves function,‚Äù says Mark Ware, MD and assistant professor of anesthesia and family medicine at McGill University.
Studies have found that patients suffering from arthritis could benefit from marijuana use. This is because naturally occurring chemicals in cannabis work to activate pathways in the body that help fight off joint inflammation."

This is an aggregate of the data I studied for my thesis titled, ""Data Mining in Presidential Debates and Speeches: How Campaign Rhetoric Shaped Voter Opinion in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Race"". The goal of my thesis was to use NLP techniques to understand how Donald Trump‚Äôs rhetoric impacted the opinions of various voter groups throughout his campaign. Here is a summary of my findings:
Trump‚Äôs words were typically more common in an American English corpus and more extreme on both ends of the sentiment spectrum
Trump not only used rhetorical devices for persuasion but also adeptly coupled these devices with the right talking points based on the composition of his audience
Precise execution of the above strategy garnered him an unexpectedly large number of votes from the white female and Hispanic demographics
I hope that others can use this dataset to answer questions of their own about the 2016 presidential campaign.

About fastText
fastText is a library for efficient learning of word representations and sentence classification. One of the key features of fastText word representation is its ability to produce vectors for any words, even made-up ones. Indeed, fastText word vectors are built from vectors of substrings of characters contained in it. This allows you to build vectors even for misspelled words or concatenation of words.
About the vectors
These pre-trained vectors contain 1 million word vectors learned with subword information on Wikipedia 2017, the UMBC webbase corpus and the statmt.org news dataset. In total, it contains 16B tokens.
The first line of the file contains the number of words in the vocabulary and the size of the vectors. Each line contains a word followed by its vectors, like in the default fastText text format. Each value is space separated. Words are ordered by descending frequency.

Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition
Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity.
An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers.
The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.

What is a Pre-trained Model?
A pre-trained model has been previously trained on a dataset and contains the weights and biases that represent the features of whichever dataset it was trained on. Learned features are often transferable to different data. For example, a model trained on a large dataset of bird images will contain learned features like edges or horizontal lines that you would be transferable your dataset.
Why use a Pre-trained Model?
Pre-trained models are beneficial to us for many reasons. By using a pre-trained model you are saving time. Someone else has already spent the time and compute resources to learn a lot of features and your model will likely benefit from it."

Magic Feature! see forum thread for more details :)
This dataset is re-uploaded since the original competition did not feature kernels, and it is made available here give people a chance to practice their data science/predictive modelling skill with this nice little dataset
Content
The goal of the problem is to predict Telstra network's fault severity at a time at a particular location based on the log data available. Each row in the main dataset (train.csv, test.csv) represents a location and a time point. They are identified by the ""id"" column, which is the key ""id"" used in other data files.
Fault severity has 3 categories: 0,1,2 (0 meaning no fault, 1 meaning only a few, and 2 meaning many).
Different types of features are extracted from log files and other sources: event_type.csv, log_feature.csv, resource_type.csv, severity_type.csv.
Note: ‚Äúseverity_type‚Äù is a feature extracted from the log files (in severity_type.csv). Often this is a severity type of a warning message coming from the log. ""severity_type"" is categorical. It does not have an ordering. ‚Äúfault_severity‚Äù is a measurement of actual reported faults from users of the network and is the target variable (in train.csv).

Does this hold true for Seattle as well? This dataset technically only contains the responses to 911 calls rather than the calls themselves, but it should be feasible to use the responses as a decent proxy for calls."

""Lynching"" historically includes not only Southern lynching but frontier lynching and vigilantism nationwide and many labor-related incidents. Persons of any race or ethnicity and either gender may have been either perpetrators or victims of lynching. The lynchings in this dataset follow an NAACP definition for including an incident in the inventory of lynchings:
There must be evidence that someone was killed;
The killing must have occurred illegally;
Three or more persons must have taken part in the killing; and
The killers must have claimed to be serving justice or tradition.
Content:
The original data came from the NAACP Lynching Records at Tuskegee Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama. Stewart Tolnay and E.M. Beck examined these records for name and event duplications and other errors with funding from a National Science Foundation Grant and made their findings available to Project HAL in 1998. Project HAL is inactive now, but it‚Äôs original purpose was to build a data set for researchers to use and to add to.
The dataset contains the following information for each of the 2806 reported lynchings:
State: State where the lynching took place
Year: Year of the lynching
Mo: Month
Day: Day
Victim: Name of the victim
County: County where the lynching occurred (keep in mind that county names have changed & boundaries redrawn)
Race: Race of the victim
Sex: Sex of the victim
Mob: Information on the mob
Offense: Victim‚Äôs alleged offense
Note: Note (if any)

We might not all eat them, but they are the meats whose grades the US Department of Agriculture has seen fit to publish. This dataset contains records on meat production and quality as far back as 1930.
After meat and poultry are inspected for wholesomeness, producers and processors may request that they have products graded for quality by a licensed Federal grader. The USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (http://www.ams.usda.gov) is the agency responsible for grading meat and poultry. Those who request grading must pay for the service. Grading for quality means the evaluation of traits related to tenderness, juiciness, and flavor of meat; and, for poultry, a normal shape that is fully fleshed and meaty and free of defects.
USDA grades are based on nationally uniform Federal standards of quality. No matter where or when a consumer purchases graded meat or poultry, it must have met the same grade criteria. The grade is stamped on the carcass or side of beef and is usually not visible on retail cuts. However, retail packages of beef, as well as poultry, will show the U.S. grade mark if they have been officially graded.
To better understand the available fields: - All fields labeled 'pounds' are really in units of indicate millions of pounds. - You can find a helpful explanation of what the different grades mean here.

law",Other,591 MB,CC0,731 views,53 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/us-gpo/united-states-code,"The United States Code (""Code"") contains the general and permanent laws of the United States, arranged into 54 broad titles according to subject matter. The organization of the Code was originally established by Congress in 1926 with the enactment of the act of June 30, 1926, chapter 712. Since then, 27 of the titles, referred to as positive law titles, have been restated and enacted into law by Congress as titles of the Code. The remaining titles, referred to as non-positive law titles, are made up of sections from many acts of Congress that were either included in the original Code or subsequently added by the editors of the Code, i.e., the Office of the Law Revision Counsel, and its predecessors in the House of Representatives. Positive law titles are identified by an asterisk on the Search & Browse page. For an explanation of the meaning of positive law, see the Positive Law Codification page.
Each title of the Code is subdivided into a combination of smaller units such as subtitles, chapters, subchapters, parts, subparts, and sections, not necessarily in that order. Sections are often subdivided into a combination of smaller units such as subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs, clauses, subclauses, and items. In the case of a positive law title, the units are determined by Congress in the laws that enact and later amend the title. In the case of a non-positive law title, the organization of the title since 1926 has been determined by the editors of the Code and has generally followed the organization of the underlying acts 1 as much as possible. For example, chapter 7 of title 42 sets out the titles, parts, and sections of the Social Security Act as corresponding subchapters, parts, and sections of the chapter.
In addition to the sections themselves, the Code includes statutory provisions set out as statutory notes, the Constitution, several sets of Federal court rules, and certain Presidential documents, such as Executive orders, determinations, notices, and proclamations, that implement or relate to statutory provisions in the Code. The Code does not include treaties, agency regulations, State or District of Columbia laws, or most acts that are temporary or special, such as those that appropriate money for specific years or that apply to only a limited number of people or a specific place. For an explanation of the process of determining which new acts are included in the Code, see the About Classification page.
The Code also contains editorially created source credits, notes, and tables that provide information about the source of Code sections, their arrangement, the references they contain, and their history.
The law contained in the Code is the product of over 200 years of legislating. Drafting styles have changed over the years, and the resulting differences in laws are reflected in the Code. Similarly, Code editorial styles and policies have evolved over the 80-plus years since the Code was first adopted. As a result, not all acts have been handled in a consistent manner in the Code over time. This guide explains the editorial styles and policies currently used to produce the Code, but the reader should be aware that some things may have been done differently in the past. However, despite the evolution of style over the years, the accuracy of the information presented in the Code has always been, and will always remain, a top priority.

Dataset is a list of film and television permits received from the Mayor's Office of Media and Entertainment in response to a series of FOIL requests in 2015. The permits stretch from October 2011 through September 2015.
Content:
ProjectTitle: The title of the film/television project.
EventName: A shorthand name for the specific shoot/event being permitted, e.g. SunsetPark-010815.
EventType: One of the following: Scouting Permit, Rigging Permit, Shooting Permit, Film Shoot / Production, DCAS Prep/Shoot/Wrap Permit, Grid Request, or Red Carpet Premiere. According to the MOME, Shooting Permit and Film Shoot / Production are interchangeable.
EventStartDate and EventEndDate: The start and end date and time of the permit.
Location: One or more locations covered by the permit.
Boro: What borough the listed locations are in.
ProjectId: An internal identifier.
CategoryName: Film or Television.
SubCategoryName: Includes values such as Pilot, Student Film, Variety, Reality, etc. This probably isn't a reliable classification for TV shows: it's chosen by the permit applicant on the online form and is not vetted by the Mayor's Office. It also includes overlapping subcategories. For example, a show could be both a Morning Show and a Talk Show but would have to choose one or the other.
CompanyName: The supplied production company name, which can be useful in connecting a working title to an actual film/show.
The project title is sometimes a variation on the actual title (e.g. Mozart in the Jungle S1 or The Wolf of Wall Street ReShoots) or a working title (e.g. Untitled Female Buddy Cop Movie instead of The Heat, St James Place instead of Bridge of Spies).
In some cases, the locations listed actually span multiple boroughs, and the Boro field only represents the primary borough, or the borough of the first listed location. In some cases, the Boro field is blank.
A given shooting permit can have any number of locations listed for a single day. According to the guidelines, the locations are supposed to be listed in the order they're used on that day. Most locations are either an address or a range of blocks in the format of STREET 1 between STREET 2 and STREET 3.
Permits are generally required when asserting the exclusive use of city property, like a sidewalk, a street, or a park. A shooting permit on a street doesn't necessarily mean there is exterior shooting on the street. It may just mean, for example, that something is being shot indoors and the crew needs special parking privileges for trucks. See ""When a Permit is Required"".
Shooting on Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) property, like in a city courthouse, involves an additional permitting process.
Shooting on MTA property or on state/federal property is subject to a different permitting process.
A shooting permit is typically, but not always, for a single day or a single overnight period.

For these 8,000 respondents, we have measures of their political attitudes, values, and affinities in 2011 as well as self-reports of their turnout and vote choice in November 2012.
Content
The VOTER (Views of the Electorate Research) Survey was conducted by the survey firm YouGov. In total, 8,000 adults (age 18+) with internet access took the survey online between November 29 and December 29, 2016. The estimated margin of error is plus or minus 2.2 percent. YouGov also supplied measures of primary voting behavior from the end of the primary period (July 2016), when these respondents had been contacted as part of a different survey project.
These respondents were originally interviewed by YouGov in 2011 to 2012 as part of the 2012 Cooperative Campaign Analysis Project (CCAP). In that survey, 45,000 respondents were first interviewed in December 2011 and were interviewed a second time in one of the 45 weekly surveys between January 1 and November 8, 2012. After the November election, 35,408 respondents were interviewed a third time. We invited 11,168 panelists from the 2012 CCAP. Of those invited, 8,637 (77 percent) completed the 2016 VOTER Survey.
The 2012 CCAP was constructed using YouGov‚Äôs sample matching procedure. A stratified sample is drawn from YouGov‚Äôs panel, which consists of people who have agreed to take occasional surveys. The strata are defined by the combination of age, gender, race, and education, and each stratum is sampled in proportion to its size in the U.S. population. Then, each element of this sample is matched to a synthetic sampling frame that is constructed from the U.S. Census Bureau‚Äôs American Community Survey, the Current Population Survey Voting and Registration Supplement, and other databases. The matching procedure finds the observation in the sample from YouGov‚Äôs panel that most closely matches each observation in the synthetic sampling frame on a set of demographic characteristics. The resulting sample is then weighted by a set of demographic and non-demographic variables.
Information on variables can be found in the ""Guide to the 2016 Voter Survey"" and included in the dataset.

The Democracy Fund, a charitable foundation committed to the protection and enhancement of democratic values, found the rise of these movements and candidates worthy of analysis. In May 2016, the Democracy Fund chose to begin a rigorous project that would supply hard data to test proposed theories to explain these phenomenon. Working with Henry Olsen of the Ethics and Public Policy Center and John Sides of George Washington University, the Democracy Fund assembled a diverse group of scholars and analysts representing political viewpoints from all angles.

So I was wondering, will this be the case for a team? If a team makes one shot, will they take a further and more difficult shot for the next one? Individuals tend to be less rational after making one shot, but how about a team as a group? Will the decision making from a group compensate for the irrationality of individuals?

We are working on a project relating to predicting and voting for Academy Award. With the Primetime Emmy Awards coming up this week, I thought it would be interesting to see if I could integrated those. I couldn't find too many well organized datasets relating to those awards. I decided to spend the afternoon and build my own. We probably won't use this information this year, but it might be something we could use in the future.
Content
I created a simple web parser in Go, and parsed the data from the Emmy Awards Website. The data is a representation of Primetime Emmy Nominees from the first Emmy Awards (1949)... to the current ones that will air Sunday September 17th, 2017. After this date, the winner will have to be updated. In work we've done with Academy Awards, we used movie title and name as the main structure for the data. I kind of felt this was a little inconsistent as certain awards focus on one or the other. With the Emmy Nominees, I made it more general with nominee and additional detail, I believe this will make the data more consistent and easier to manipulate.
Acknowledgements
I based the structure of the data from the Kaggle dataset of the Academy Awards . I would also like to acknowledge the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences for providing the data on their website.

Texts are balanced in terms of the variety, consisting of 48 European Portuguese texts and 52 Brazilian Portuguese texts. You can find more information in the paper that describes the corpus. The complete inventory of texts is here and more detail regarding annotation can be found here.
Part of Speech (POS) Tags
The works in this corpus have been automatically tagged for their part of speech (POS). The tagset used to annotate the corpus is presented in the table below. It contains not only the classic POS tags (e.g. V, DET, N) but also a couple of compound tags, such as the combination of preposition plus determiner as (PREP+DET) or verb plus pronoun (V+P). The tool used to annotate the corpus was TreeTagger.
Category POS Example Adjective ADJ bonita Adverb ADV muita Determiner DET os Cardinal CARD primeiro Noun NOM mesa Pronoun P eles Preposition PRP de Verb V fazer Interjection I Oh! Commas VIRG , Punctuation SENT .
Studies report that TreeTagger achieves performance higher than 95% accuracy in attributing the correct POS tag and lemma of a token.

It was then cleaned, removing both multiword expressions and very common words. Dialect regions that didn‚Äôt correspond to a single state or set of cities (e.g. South) were mapped to the most populous cities within each region. For example, within the Pacific Northwest dialect region, the most populous cities (Seattle, Tacoma, Portland, Salem, Eugene) were added to this dataset as subregions.

The Current Employment Statistics (CES) program provides estimates of employment, hours, and earnings information on a national basis and in considerable industry detail. The Bureau of Labor Statistics collects payroll data each month from a sample of business and government establishments in all nonfarm activities.
Employment data include series for total employment, number of women employees, and number of production or nonsupervisory employees. Estimates of average hourly earnings, average weekly hours, average weekly earnings, and average weekly overtime hours are produced for both all employees and for production or nonsupervisory employees. Overtime hours are produced for manufacturing industries only.
A sample of approximately 147,000 businesses and government agencies representing approximately 634,000 worksites throughout the United States is utilized for this monthly survey. The sample contains about 300,000 employer units.
All employment, hours and earnings series are classified according to the 2012 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The industry code used in the survey corresponds to the NAICS code, except in those cases where multiple industries have been combined.
Content:
Please refer to ce.txt for a description of how to parse and use the unique identifiers.
This dataset was collected on June 27th, 2017 and may not be up-to-date.
Summary of Data Available: For all employees, women employees, and production or nonsupervisory employees, CES publishes about 4,300 monthly series. The series for all employees cover more than 900 industries on both a seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted basis.
For private-sector industries, nearly 7,500 series are published each month for average weekly earnings, average hourly earnings, average weekly hours, and, in manufacturing, average weekly overtime hours. Hours and earnings data for all employees are available for about 620 industries and for production or nonsupervisory employees about 550 industries.
From the employment, hours, and earnings series, CES produces about 7,500 derivative series, such as indexes and real earnings series.
Most employment series begin in 1990, although some series, including industry supersectors, are available from 1939. Supersectors include: mining and logging; construction; manufacturing; trade, transportation, and utilities; information; financial activities; professional and business services, education and health services; leisure and hospitality, other services, and government.
Frequency of Observations: Data series are monthly in most cases; quarterly averages are available for total employment, average weekly hours, and average overtime hours, seasonally adjusted (datatypes 19, 20, 25, 36, and 37).
Annual averages are available for all series that are not adjusted for seasonality (except for the 12-month diffusion index series).
Data Characteristics: Earnings are measured in dollars and are published to the nearest cent (two decimal places). Average weekly and overtime hours are measured in hours and are published to the nearest tenth of an hour (one decimal place).
Employment is measured in thousands of workers and is stored with no decimal place for all supersectors and for both durable goods and nondurable goods in manufacturing. Employment for all other industries are stored to one decimal place.
Special characteristics of the data are footnoted where necessary. For example; I indicates that the seasonally adjusted series is independently seasonally adjusted and not used in aggregating to higher summary industries. For all employees, higher summary series, such as total nonfarm, are aggregated up from the 3-digit NAICS level.
Each year with the release of January estimates in February, CES data are re-anchored to universe counts of nonfarm employment or benchmarks for the most recent March. For example, CES introduced March 2016 benchmark counts with the release of January 2017 first preliminary estimates in February 2017. On a not seasonally adjusted basis, all series are subject to revision back to the prior year‚Äôs benchmarked data (21 months of data), while seasonally adjusted estimates may be revised back 5 years (or more).

Article Five of the United States Constitution describes a process that allows for alteration of the federal Constitution. So far, 27 amendments have been fully added to the federal Constitution but there have been a lot of proposals that didn‚Äôt make it through. This dataset contains information about a whopping 11,797 Constitutional amendments that have been proposed to Congress from 1787 to 2014!
Content:
This dataset consists of 11,797 rows with 17 fields and was compiled by NARA volunteers that transcribed information from written records that were issued by Congress. Because a lot of the information comes from written records, the dataset may not be a complete record of all amendment proposals. Proposals before 1973 were taken from various government publications and proposals after 1973 are publicly available on https://www.congress.gov.
Identifier: Unique code generated by NARA that serves as a unique identifier.
Source_code: Code generated by NARA that represents the government publication or website where the information was transcribed.
Source_citation: Bibliographic citation of the government publication or website from which the information was transcribed.
Source_index_number: An index number listed within the source publication.
Title_or_description_from_source: Title or description of the proposed amendment, transcribed from the source publication or website.
Date_approximation: When the date is estimated, the term includes ‚Äúcirca‚Äù, otherwise it is left blank.
Year: Year that the amendment was proposed in Congress (YYYY format).
Month: Month that the amendment was proposed in Congress (blank if unknown).
Day: Day that the amendment was proposed in Congress (blank if unknown).
Congress: The number for the congress in which the amendment was proposed.
Congressional_session: The number or designation of the session of Congress in which the amendment was proposed.
Joint_resolution_chamber: The chamber of Congress in which the amendment was proposed.
Joint_resolution_number: The number assigned to the proposed amendment by Congress. (Amendments are submitted as joint resolutions)
Sponsor_name: The name of the member of Congress or group who proposed the amendment. (Blank if unknown).
Sponsor_state_or_territory: The U.S. state or territory represented by the amendment‚Äôs sponsoring member of Congress.
Committee_of_referral: The committee to which the amendment was referred for further consideration, following formal introduction to Congress.
Last_modified: the timestamp of the most recent modification made on the data contained within the particular row.
Acknowledgements:
The National Archives and Records Administration created this dataset as part of the Amending America initiative. To prepare for the 2016 ""Amending America"" exhibition at the National Archives Museum in Washington, D.C., NARA volunteers and staff transcribed and edited over 11,000 entries representing proposed amendments to the U.S. Constitution, as recorded by Congress. http://www.archives.gov/amending-america
Inspiration:
This is an interesting dataset because it contains a lot of history that isn‚Äôt necessarily reflected in the Constitution. You could use it to glean insight into the political climates at different times in the history of the United States. For instance, what kind of amendments were being proposed during the Civil War? Who proposed the most amendments? Historically, have there been more proposals during any particular time of year?"

This collection of information is known as the National Bridge Inventory (NBI), and it has been captured electronically since 1972. While parts of the data were first made available to the public in 1997, it wasn't until 2007 that the FWHA decided to make all elements of the NBI database publicly available.
This NBI data set contains 135 variables describing over 600,000 bridges. Variables describe the location, structure, maintenance, usage, status, and other aspects of the bridges. An extremely detailed (124 page) pdf guide to the variables, codes, and other metadata on the NBI can be found here:

This data set contains variables describing the cost of bridge (ITEM94) and roadway (ITEM95) improvement in thousands of dollars. How many improvement projects could be completed for $20B?
Use of the NBI data also enables FHWA to satisfy its requirements under 23 U.S.C. 144, which mandate the inventory, classification, cost estimates for replacement or rehabilitation, and assignment of replacement or rehabilitation priorities for all highway bridges on all public roads. Can you come up with better cost estimates and classifications? For example, in the absence of additional information, FHWA recommends using 10% of the bridge cost as a roadway improvement cost estimator.
Using Latitude and Longitude data and operational status (ITEM41), can you find any bridges to nowhere?"

On April 18, 2017, prime minister Theresa May announced that she was seeking a general election to be held on June 8. The day after, the MPs voted to dissolve Parliament and a new election is confirmed. It would be interesting to do some analysis of past election results on the 650 constituencies in to find out:
The most vulnerable seats from each party.
The seats targeted by each party.
Can the Brexit referendum result affect the outcome of this election in a particular region of the UK?
How a swing of x% from party A to party B affect the seat distribution?
among many other relevant questions.

Content
The VidTIMIT dataset is comprised of video and corresponding audio recordings of 35 people(though the original data contains the data for 43 People but some links were missing), reciting short sentences. It can be useful for research on topics such as automatic lip reading, multi-view face recognition, multi-modal speech recognition and person identification. The dataset was recorded in 3 sessions, with a mean delay of 7 days between Session 1 and 2, and 6 days between Session 2 and 3. The sentences were chosen from the test section of the TIMIT corpus. There are 10 sentences per person. The first six sentences (sorted alpha-numerically by filename) are assigned to Session 1. The next two sentences are assigned to Session 2 with the remaining two to Session 3.
The first two sentences for all persons are the same, with the remaining eight generally different for each person.
The corresponding audio is stored as a mono, 16 bit, 32 kHz WAV file.

Overwatch,Who are the best heroes?,EdoardoPiccari,6,"Version 1,2017-02-26",video games,CSV,2 KB,CC0,"3,628 views",172 downloads,,2 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/edopic/overwatch,"Overwatch is a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment.
Overwatch puts players into two teams of six, with each player selecting one of several pre-defined hero characters with unique movement, attributes, and abilities; these heroes are divided into four classes: Offense, Defense, Tank and Support. Players on a team work together to secure and defend control points on a map and/or escort a payload across the map in a limited amount of time. Players gain cosmetic rewards that do not affect gameplay, such as character skins and victory poses, as they continue to play in matches. The game was launched with casual play, while Blizzard added competitive ranked play about a month after launch. Additionally, Blizzard has developed and added new characters, maps, and game modes post-release, while stating that all Overwatch updates will remain free, with the only additional cost to players being microtransactions to earn additional cosmetic rewards.

League of Legends MatchID dataset V2.0,+100 000 match ids. For further use with Riot API and League game analysis,LanVuku≈°iƒç,6,"Version 2,2017-02-27|Version 1,2017-02-19",,CSV,3 MB,CC0,"6,431 views",246 downloads,,,https://www.kaggle.com/lanls1/matchidv1,"League of Legends MatchID dataset V2.0
As people who like data analysis , but young enough to still like gaming, we thought that League of legends would be a great game to analyze. Due to competitive play some statistics and predictions were quite welcome. There are of course a lot of websites that offer that by them selves, but we think that League community needed an open dataset to work with, as there was none that offered some real volume of data. There came the idea for a bigger dataset which would offer other people to drive their projects without the struggle of long lasting process of parsing matches with Riot API (which has a limit of 500 calls per 10 minutes...so yea)
This is NOT the finished project, but more like a post along the way. The dataset only consists of one column and its basically useless by it self. The file consists of 223 715 match IDs of ranked games . Each column represents the MatchId of a single match played in League, which can be than accessed with Riot API The purpose is only to allow others like us, to continue the research with Riot API with some pre gathered data and save them some precious time that way.
The final dataset ""League of Legends MatchesDataset V1.0"" we will be posting, consists of 100 000 matches in JSON which will be directly suitable for data analysis.
Link to the dataset: WIP
We are also open sourcing the data gathering program (written in python)
GitHub link: GitHub program
This project has been posted by me (Lan Vuku≈°iƒç) as data scientist but the main credit goes to lead programmer Matej Urbas who is responsible for the data gathering in this project and without whom the project would not exist.
We are happy to give the dataset out for free, to let the comunity use that dataset. We would love to see what people are going to create. We know that we are ""rookies"" in that field but would still like to contribute to evergrowing field of data science. So if there is really anything that should be changed in upcoming updates please feel free to message us and tell us your thoughts.

State surveillance systems are based on reports of blood lead tests from laboratories.

The Public Libraries Survey (PLS) is conducted annually by the Institute of Museum and Library Services under the mandate in the Museum and Library Services Act of 2010. The data file includes all public libraries identified by state library administrative agencies in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The reporting unit for the survey is the administrative entity, defined as the agency that is legally established under local or state law to provide public library service to the population of a local jurisdiction. The FY 2014 PLS collected state characteristics data, including the state total population estimate, number of central and branch libraries, and the total library visits and circulation transactions, and data on each public library, such as its name and location, population of legal service area, print and digital collections, full-time-equivalent staff, and operating revenue and expenditures.

The museum dataset is an evolving list of museums and related organizations in the United States. The data file includes basic information about each organization (name, address, phone, website, and revenue) plus the museum type or discipline. The discipline type is based on the National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities, which the National Center for Charitable Statistics and IRS use to classify nonprofit organizations.
Non-museum organizations may be included. For example, a non-museum organization may be included in the data file because it has a museum-like name on its IRS record for tax-exempt organizations. Museum foundations may also be included.
Museums may be missing. For example, local municipal museums may be undercounted because original data sources used to create the compilation did not include them.
Museums may be listed multiple times. For example, one museum may be listed as both itself and its parent organization because it was listed differently in each original data sources. Duplicate records are especially common for museums located within universities.
Information about museums may be outdated. The original scan and compilation of data sources occurred in 2014. Scans are no longer being done to update the data sources or add new data sources to the compilation. Information about museums may have changed since it was originally included in the file.

The 2016 edition of Freedom of the Press, which provides analytical reports and numerical scores for 199 countries and territories, continues a process conducted by Freedom House since 1980. Each country and territory is given a total press freedom score from 0 (best) to 100 (worst) on the basis of 23 methodology questions divided into three subcategories. The total score determines the status designation of Free, Partly Free, or Not Free. The scores and reports included in Freedom of the Press 2016 cover events that took place between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2015.
The level of press freedom in each country and territory is evaluated through 23 methodology questions divided into three broad categories: the legal environment, the political environment, and the economic environment. For each methodology question, a lower number of points is allotted for a more free situation, while a higher number of points is allotted for a less free environment. A country or territory‚Äôs final score (from 0 to 100) represents the total of the points allotted for each question. A total score of 0 to 30 results in a press freedom status of Free; 31 to 60 results in a status of Partly Free; and 61 to 100 indicates a status of Not Free.
The legal environment category encompasses an examination of both the laws and regulations that could influence media content, and the extent to which they are used in practice to enable or restrict the media‚Äôs ability to operate. We assess the positive impact of legal and constitutional guarantees for freedom of expression; the potentially negative aspects of security legislation, the penal code, and other statutes; penalties for libel and defamation; the existence of and ability to use freedom of information legislation; the independence of the judiciary and official regulatory bodies; registration requirements for both media outlets and journalists; and the ability of journalists‚Äô organizations to operate freely.
Under the political environment category, we evaluate the degree of political influence in the content of news media. Issues examined include the editorial independence of both state-owned and privately owned outlets; access to information and sources; official censorship and self-censorship; the vibrancy of the media and the diversity of news available within each country or territory; the ability of both foreign and local reporters to cover the news in person without obstacles or harassment; and reprisals against journalists or bloggers by the state or other actors, including arbitrary detention, violent assaults, and other forms of intimidation.
Our third category examines the economic environment for the media. This includes the structure of media ownership; transparency and concentration of ownership; the costs of establishing media as well as any impediments to news production and distribution; the selective withholding of advertising or subsidies by the state or other actors; the impact of corruption and bribery on content; and the extent to which the economic situation in a country or territory affects the development and sustainability of the media."

The Type Allocation Code (TAC) is the initial eight-digit portion of the 15-digit IMEI and 16-digit IMEISV codes used to uniquely identify wireless devices. (Wikipedia)
TAC numbers can be used to identify devices connected to networks. Complete TAC databases are hard to find and cost a furtune, as maintaining them and keeping them up to date is labour intensive due to the large amount of devices being released every day.
Content
The dataset contains information about the devices' TAC number, manufacturer, model, aliases of the model, operating system, year of release and LTE compatibility.
Some devices may have multiple TAC numbers, as they are different subversions of the same hardware. This TAC database is nowhere near complete, and some of the data provided here could be incorrect, as even manufacturers sometimes share inaccurate information about their own devices. LTE capability is the worst offender in this case, as companies often release TAC information with contradictory stats about LTE compatibility.

Refer to the article‚Äôs supplementary materials for more information.
The dataset contains abstracts from peer-reviewed studies on climate change that were labeled using the CrowdFlower platform. Abstracts were each assessed by multiple raters (n = 7) for their narrativity. Narrativity includes whether the abstract appeals to the reader, has a narrative perspective, using sensory language, and other factors. The dataset also contains additional information about the studies including citation rate, journal identity, and number of authors.
Past research
From the study abstract:
Peer-reviewed publications focusing on climate change are growing exponentially with the consequence that the uptake and influence of individual papers varies greatly. Here, we derive metrics of narrativity from psychology and literary theory, and use these metrics to test the hypothesis that more narrative climate change writing is more likely to be influential, using citation frequency as a proxy for influence. From a sample of 732 scientific abstracts drawn from the climate change literature, we find that articles with more narrative abstracts are cited more often. This effect is closely associated with journal identity: higher-impact journals tend to feature more narrative articles, and these articles tend to be cited more often. These results suggest that writing in a more narrative style increases the uptake and influence of articles in climate literature, and perhaps in scientific literature more broadly.
Inspiration
Can you replicate the authors' findings? Are abstracts with narrative qualities cited more often? What other variables are associated with narrativity in scientific abstracts about climate change? Examine relationships between citation rate, abstract length, abstract authors, and more.

Potential question(s) to get started with!
What are some predictors of health scores? What relevant outside data can you bring to bear on the question, including restaurant reviews, sentiment analysis, demographic data, etc?

This dataset takes the Environment Agency's Risk of Flooding from Rivers and Sea, and places English postcodes in their appropriate flood risk area, allowing you to look up flood risk from postcode.
Content
Risk of Flooding from Rivers and Sea consists of geographical areas within England which are at risk of flooding from rivers and sea. Each area is assigned a flood risk within a banding:
High
Medium
Low
Very low
None
Open Flood Risk by Postcode takes postcodes as point locations (from Open Postcode Geo) and places the postcode in the appropriate flood risk area. It is important to note that actual properties within a specific postcode may have a slightly different point location and therefore be in a different flood risk area. Generally speaking the point location of a postcode is the point location of the central property in that postcode.
For a full field list and explanations of values see the Open Flood Risk by Postcode documentation.

Since 1967, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) has provided the public the right to request access to records from any federal agency. It is often described as the law that keeps citizens in the know about their government. Federal agencies are required to disclose any information requested under the FOIA unless it falls under one of nine exemptions which protect interests such as personal privacy, national security, and law enforcement. As Congress, the President, and the Supreme Court have all recognized, the Act is a vital part of our democracy.
A FOIA request can be made for any agency record. You can also specify the format in which you wish to receive the records (for example, printed or electronic form). The Act does not require agencies to create new records or to conduct research, analyze data, or answer questions when responding to requests. Each federal agency handles its own records in response to requests. There are currently one hundred agencies subject to the FOIA with several hundred offices that process FOIA requests.

Title: Wine Quality
Sources Created by: Paulo Cortez (Univ. Minho), Antonio Cerdeira, Fernando Almeida, Telmo Matos and Jose Reis (CVRVV) @ 2009
Past Usage:

In the above reference, two datasets were created, using red and white wine samples. The inputs include objective tests (e.g. PH values) and the output is based on sensory data (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). Several data mining methods were applied to model these datasets under a regression approach. The support vector machine model achieved the best results. Several metrics were computed: MAD, confusion matrix for a fixed error tolerance (T), etc. Also, we plot the relative importances of the input variables (as measured by a sensitivity analysis procedure).
Relevant Information:
The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese ""Vinho Verde"" wine. For more details, consult: http://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/ or the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).
These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are munch more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods.
Number of Instances: red wine - 1599; white wine - 4898.
Number of Attributes: 11 + output attribute
Note: several of the attributes may be correlated, thus it makes sense to apply some sort of feature selection.
Attribute information:
For more information, read [Cortez et al., 2009].
Input variables (based on physicochemical tests): 1 - fixed acidity (tartaric acid - g / dm^3) 2 - volatile acidity (acetic acid - g / dm^3) 3 - citric acid (g / dm^3) 4 - residual sugar (g / dm^3) 5 - chlorides (sodium chloride - g / dm^3 6 - free sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3) 7 - total sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3) 8 - density (g / cm^3) 9 - pH 10 - sulphates (potassium sulphate - g / dm3) 11 - alcohol (% by volume) Output variable (based on sensory data): 12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
Missing Attribute Values: None
Description of attributes:
1 - fixed acidity: most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily)
2 - volatile acidity: the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste
3 - citric acid: found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines
4 - residual sugar: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet
5 - chlorides: the amount of salt in the wine
6 - free sulfur dioxide: the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine
7 - total sulfur dioxide: amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine
8 - density: the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content
9 - pH: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale
10 - sulphates: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant
11 - alcohol: the percent alcohol content of the wine
Output variable (based on sensory data): 12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)"

We know that the spindles must occur in the middle of a certain type of waves (theta waves), so we take as a training set a mixture of spindles and theta waves, and associate the outcome value 1 (as factor) for spindles and value 0 for theta waves. The 1st part of the algorithm already identified the ‚Äúspindle candidates‚Äù from windows of 1 second in the EEG raw waves and sent these candidates to the ‚Äúauthentication‚Äù program, which is the one described.

‚Ä¢ Can we make the word cloud for each character (and perhaps compare it with other movie characters by same authors and see who is similar to who)
‚Ä¢ Can we train a chat bot for Oogway to Po so kids can talk to it and it would respond the same way as Oogway or Po would
‚Ä¢ Can we calculate the average length or dialogue
‚Ä¢ Can we estimate the difficulty level of vocabulary being used and perhaps compare it with movies of other genre
‚Ä¢ Can we compare the script with some religious text and find out similarities"

This dataset provides information on violence in California's criminal justice system, whether the victim was a civilian or an officer or if the incident occurred during the arrest or while a subject was in custody. It's composed of a few related datasets:
Use of force incidents: The use of force (URSUS) incidents that result in serious bodily injury or death or involved the discharge of a firearm are reported annually from LEAs and other entities throughout the state that employ peace officers. The URSUS data is narrowly defined and does not represent the totality of use of force incidents that occur in California. LEAs are only required to report use of force incidents that result in serious bodily injury or death of either the civilian or the officer and all incidents where there is a discharge of a firearm. As such, caution must be used when using the data for comparisons or in calculating rates.
Law enforcement officers killed: Law Enforcement Officer's Killed or Assaulted (LEOKA) data are reported as part of the Federal Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program by LEAs throughout the state. LEOKA data are summary data, meaning it is a collection of information describing the totality of incidents, not a collection at the detailed, incident level. LEOKA is a federally mandated collection. From the 1960's until 1990, the CJSC did not retain any of the LEOKA data; the forms were passed along to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). In 1990, the DOJ began to collect and retain the data from the LEOKA form for statistical purposes, but it wasn't until 2000, that full retention at the State level was defined and standardized.
Death in Custody & Arrest-Related Deaths: State and local law enforcement agencies and correctional facilities report information on deaths that occur in custody or during the process of arrest in compliance with Section 12525 of the California Government Code. Contributors include: California law enforcement agencies, county probation departments, state hospitals, and state correctional facilities. Data are subject to revision as reports are received by the California Department of Justice (DOJ); figures in previous and current releases may not match.
Citizens' Complaints Against Peace Officers: State and local law enforcement agencies that employ peace officers provide Citizens' Complaints Against Peace Officers (CCAPO) data via an annual summary. The information includes the number of criminal and non-criminal complaints reported by citizens and the number of complaints sustained. Assembly Bill 953 (2015) modified the reporting requirements to expand the types of findings and also include complaints based upon racial and identity profiling claims. 2016 was the first year of collection under the new reporting requirements.

The data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of ""farmed wetlands"" as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition. Contact the Service's Regional Wetland Coordinator for additional information on what types of farmed wetlands are included on wetland maps.

Marijuana may get a bad rep in the media as far as the decriminalization debate goes, but its health benefits can no longer go unnoticed. With various studies linking long-term marijuana use to positive, health-related effects, there are more than just a few reasons to smoke some weed every day.
A study done by the Boston Medical Center and the Boston University of Medicine, examined 589 drug users‚Äîmore than 8 out of 10 of whom were pot smokers. It determined that ‚Äúweed aficionados‚Äù were no more likely to visit the doctor than non-drug users. If an increased risk of contracting ailments is what‚Äôs preventing you from smoking more weed, it looks like you‚Äôre in the clear!
One of the greatest medicinal benefits of marijuana is its pain relieving qualities, which make it especially effective for treating chronic pain. From menstruation cramps to nerve pain, as little as three puffs of bud a day can help provide the same relief as synthetic painkillers. Marijuana relieves pain by ‚Äúchanging the way the nerves function,‚Äù says Mark Ware, MD and assistant professor of anesthesia and family medicine at McGill University.
Studies have found that patients suffering from arthritis could benefit from marijuana use. This is because naturally occurring chemicals in cannabis work to activate pathways in the body that help fight off joint inflammation."

This is an aggregate of the data I studied for my thesis titled, ""Data Mining in Presidential Debates and Speeches: How Campaign Rhetoric Shaped Voter Opinion in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Race"". The goal of my thesis was to use NLP techniques to understand how Donald Trump‚Äôs rhetoric impacted the opinions of various voter groups throughout his campaign. Here is a summary of my findings:
Trump‚Äôs words were typically more common in an American English corpus and more extreme on both ends of the sentiment spectrum
Trump not only used rhetorical devices for persuasion but also adeptly coupled these devices with the right talking points based on the composition of his audience
Precise execution of the above strategy garnered him an unexpectedly large number of votes from the white female and Hispanic demographics
I hope that others can use this dataset to answer questions of their own about the 2016 presidential campaign.

Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition
Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity.
An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers.
The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.

What is a Pre-trained Model?
A pre-trained model has been previously trained on a dataset and contains the weights and biases that represent the features of whichever dataset it was trained on. Learned features are often transferable to different data. For example, a model trained on a large dataset of bird images will contain learned features like edges or horizontal lines that you would be transferable your dataset.
Why use a Pre-trained Model?
Pre-trained models are beneficial to us for many reasons. By using a pre-trained model you are saving time. Someone else has already spent the time and compute resources to learn a lot of features and your model will likely benefit from it."

Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition
In this work we investigate the effect of the convolutional network depth on its accuracy in the large-scale image recognition setting. Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.

Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision
Convolutional networks are at the core of most state-of-the-art computer vision solutions for a wide variety of tasks. Since 2014 very deep convolutional networks started to become mainstream, yielding substantial gains in various benchmarks. Although increased model size and computational cost tend to translate to immediate quality gains for most tasks (as long as enough labeled data is provided for training), computational efficiency and low parameter count are still enabling factors for various use cases such as mobile vision and big-data scenarios. Here we explore ways to scale up networks in ways that aim at utilizing the added computation as efficiently as possible by suitably factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization. We benchmark our methods on the ILSVRC 2012 classification challenge validation set demonstrate substantial gains over the state of the art: 21.2% top-1 and 5.6% top-5 error for single frame evaluation using a network with a computational cost of 5 billion multiply-adds per inference and with using less than 25 million parameters. With an ensemble of 4 models and multi-crop evaluation, we report 3.5% top-5 error on the validation set (3.6% error on the test set) and 17.3% top-1 error on the validation set.

ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0% which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called ‚Äúdropout‚Äù that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.

What is a Pre-trained Model?
A pre-trained model has been previously trained on a dataset and contains the weights and biases that represent the features of whichever dataset it was trained on. Learned features are often transferable to different data. For example, a model trained on a large dataset of bird images will contain learned features like edges or horizontal lines that you would be transferable your dataset.

Densely Connected Convolutional Networks
Recent work has shown that convolutional networks can be substantially deeper, more accurate, and efficient to train if they contain shorter connections between layers close to the input and those close to the output. In this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce the Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections - one between each layer and its subsequent layer - our network has L(L+1)/2 direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters. We evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet). DenseNets obtain significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on most of them, whilst requiring less memory and computation to achieve high performance. Code and models are available at this https URL.

Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision
Convolutional networks are at the core of most state-of-the-art computer vision solutions for a wide variety of tasks. Since 2014 very deep convolutional networks started to become mainstream, yielding substantial gains in various benchmarks. Although increased model size and computational cost tend to translate to immediate quality gains for most tasks (as long as enough labeled data is provided for training), computational efficiency and low parameter count are still enabling factors for various use cases such as mobile vision and big-data scenarios. Here we explore ways to scale up networks in ways that aim at utilizing the added computation as efficiently as possible by suitably factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization. We benchmark our methods on the ILSVRC 2012 classification challenge validation set demonstrate substantial gains over the state of the art: 21.2% top-1 and 5.6% top-5 error for single frame evaluation using a network with a computational cost of 5 billion multiply-adds per inference and with using less than 25 million parameters. With an ensemble of 4 models and multi-crop evaluation, we report 3.5% top-5 error on the validation set (3.6% error on the test set) and 17.3% top-1 error on the validation set.

Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition
Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity.
An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers.
The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.

How would you like it, if you can predict the probability of the team batting second winning the match?
What if I tell you that, you can start making these predictions right from the start of the second innings?
I have always been fascinated by the idea of making predictions about which team is going to win the match or how much the teams would score at the end of each innings. The availability of ball by ball data opens up a lot of possibilities for creating different kinds of aggregations at the player, match, team and other levels. I intend to add more datasets featuring aggregations built on top of the ball by ball data."

I would be updating the dataset monthly to include newer games of the current season.
The dataset includes 2 JSON files. One of the files describes in-game match stats for every match of the past 4 seasons (current season included) like player touches, passes, shots, yellow cards, saves etc. Some of the stats are available as aggregate stats for the entire team and some of them are player specific.

Explore the archive of relevant economic information: relevant news on all indicators with explanations, data on past publications on the economy of the United States, Britain, Japan and other developed countries, volatility assessments and much more. For the construction of their forecast models, the use of in-depth training is optimal, with a learning model built on the basis of EU and Forex data. The economic calendar is an indispensable assistant for the trader.
Data set
The data set is created in the form of an Excel spreadsheet (two files 2011-2013, 2014-2018), which can be found at boot time. You can see the source of the data on the site https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/
column - Event date
column - Event time (time New York)
column - Country of the event
column - The degree of volatility (possible fluctuations in currency, indices, etc.) caused by this event
column - Description of the event
column - Evaluation of the event according to the actual data, which came out better than the forecast, worse or correspond to it
column - Data format (%, K x103, M x106, T x109)
column - Actual event data
column - Event forecast data
column - Previous data on this event (with comments if there were any interim changes).
Inspiration
Use the historical EU in conjunction with the Forex data (exchange rates, indices, metals, oil, stocks) to forecast subsequent Forex data in order to minimize investment risks (combine fundamental market analysis and technical).
Historical events of the EU used as a forecast of the subsequent (for example, the calculation of the probability of an increase in the rate of the Fed).
Investigate the impact of combinations of EC events on the degree of market volatility at different time periods.
To trace the main trends in the economies of the leading countries (for example, a decrease in the demand for unemployment benefits).

The LabelMe project has been run out of MIT for many years, and allows users to upload and annotate images. Since the labels are crowdsourced, they can be of poor quality. I have been proofreading these labels for several months, correcting spelling mistakes and coalescing similar labels into a single label when possible. I have also rejected many labels that did not seem to make sense.
Content
The images in the LabelMe project as well as the raw metadata were downloaded from MIT servers. All data is in the public domain. Images within LabelMe may have been taken as far back as the early 2000s, and run up to the present day.
I have worked through 5% of the LabelMe dataset thus far. I decided to create a dataset pertaining to meals (labels such as plate, glass, napkins, fork, etc.) since there were a fair number of those in the 5% I have curated thus far. Most of the images in this dataset are of table settings.
This dataset contains: 596 unique images 2734 labeled shapes outlining objects in these images 1782 labeled image grids, with a single number representing which portion of a grid cell is filled with a labeled object

About fastText
fastText is a library for efficient learning of word representations and sentence classification. One of the key features of fastText word representation is its ability to produce vectors for any words, even made-up ones. Indeed, fastText word vectors are built from vectors of substrings of characters contained in it. This allows you to build vectors even for misspelled words or concatenation of words.
About the vectors
These pre-trained vectors contain 1 million word vectors that were learned using Wikipedia 2017, the UMBC webbase corpus and the statmt.org news dataset. In total, it contains 16B tokens.
The first line of the file contains the number of words in the vocabulary and the size of the vectors. Each line contains a word followed by its vectors, like in the default fastText text format. Each value is space separated. Words are ordered by descending frequency.

This Dataset represents essentially the entirety of the Astro-physics section for Arxiv as the dataset spans from January 1993 to April 2003, beginning a few months after the inception of Arxiv. It represents the co-authorship and collaboration network of this community in Arxiv as an undirected graph where an edge between two nodes means they co-authored a paper before.
Content
This dataset includes two files, one txt and the other csv. The two are identical in terms of content, they merely represent two different file types of the same dataset. Each file has a description header at the top, followed by two columns which contain all of the edges in the network. Each row represents an undirected edge between the two author id's i.e. these two authors co-authored a paper together.

I am planning to compare Above 18 years of male and female between the different class passengers in Titanic Data set
Content
A century has sailed by since the luxury steamship RMS Titanic met its catastrophic end in the North Atlantic, plunging two miles to the ocean floors after sideswiping an iceberg during its maiden voyage.Rather than the intended Port of New York, a deep-sea grave became the pride of the White Star Line‚Äôs final destination in the early hours of April 15, 1912.More than 1,500 people lost their lives in the disaster In this project I will be performing an exploratory analysis on the data
Acknowledgements
I noticed that more women survived in raw number and percentage than men and opposite are true of 3rd class passengers. The bars are a good choice to show the difference between categories, but you may want to look into a grouped bar chart1 for an easier comparison of how many survived or didn't in each group. While there were far more men on the boat, less survived than the women. The class seemed to have a direct effect on a passenger's chance of survival. While it is good to see the difference in the numbers of those who survived to those who didn't.

Halloween is one of the largest datasets out there. In the trick-or-treat baskets little kids carry down the streets is a bank of knowledge and data that can unleash the trends found in communities around America. When I want trick-or-treating this halloween, I was intrigued to find what kind of candy I got, which one I got the most of, and most importantly, how did the price affect consumer choices in my community.
When I got back from trick-or treating this October 31st, 2017 (data is fresh like a cucumber), I made sure to empty out what I collected in my middle-class community and sort it out by brand, type/category, price, flavor, etc. After deciding which factors were most relevant, I created three graphs - one bar graph showing the amount of candies collected for each brand, another bar graph looking at the quantity for each type/category of confectionery, and finally, a line graph that analyzed the relationship between unit price per piece and amount of candies collected. All of this is for the sole purpose of displaying how different factors such as brand and price affect consumer choices, appeal to the general population, and what kind of candies to be expecting next year! This is an analysis of middle class economics, brand appeal, and choice of consumers.
I would like to thank my sister, who helped contribute to half of my dataset by trick-or-treating in different parts of the neighborhood, making sure the sample collected would be diverse! I also appreciate my dad's interest in this project and his own expertise that was involved in filtering everything out and making the dataset as accurate as possible!
From publishing this dataset, I hope to inspire many more young data scientists such as myself to take on new projects that intrigue them or analyze their own halloween candy from their community/neighborhood! I wanted to see how simple festivals like Halloween are affected by variables like consumer choice, price range, and brand appeal. Keep in mind, this is an analysis of my middle-class community. There are many more datasets and demographics waiting to be analyzed!"

This dataset includes 5671 requests collected from the Reddit community Random Acts of Pizza between December 8, 2010 and September 29, 2013 (retrieved on September 30, 2013). All requests ask for the same thing: a free pizza. The outcome of each request -- whether its author received a pizza or not -- is known. Meta-data includes information such as: time of the request, activity of the requester, community-age of the requester, etc.
This dataset was featured in our completed playground competition entitled Random Acts of Pizza. The objective of the competition was to create an algorithm capable of predicting which requests will garner a cheesy (but sincere!) act of kindness.
Content
The data are stored in JSON format. Each JSON entry corresponds to one request (the first and only request by the requester on Random Acts of Pizza). We have removed fields from the test set which would not be available at the time of posting. The datasets include the following fields:
""giver_username_if_known"": Reddit username of giver if known, i.e. the person satisfying the request (""N/A"" otherwise).
""number_of_downvotes_of_request_at_retrieval"": Number of downvotes at the time the request was collected.

""requester_account_age_in_days_at_request"": Account age of requester in days at time of request.
""requester_account_age_in_days_at_retrieval"": Account age of requester in days at time of retrieval.
""requester_days_since_first_post_on_raop_at_request"": Number of days between requesters first post on RAOP and this request (zero if requester has never posted before on RAOP).
""requester_days_since_first_post_on_raop_at_retrieval"": Number of days between requesters first post on RAOP and time of retrieval.
""requester_number_of_comments_at_request"": Total number of comments on Reddit by requester at time of request.

This dataset contains the selected predictions of all Kaggle participants. These predictions were collected and locked in prior to the start of the tournament.
The NCAA tournament is a single-elimination tournament that begins with 68 teams. There are four games, usually called the ‚Äúplay-in round,‚Äù before the traditional bracket action starts. Due to competition timing, these games are included in the prediction files but should not be used in analysis, as it‚Äôs possible that the prediction was submitted after the play-in round games were over.

Wars are one of the few things the human species isn't very proud of. In recent times, major political leaders have taken up steps that both increase and decrease the tension between the allies and the rivals.

This era of comfort seems delusional when we visualise and try to predict how close the next great war might be.

On Jan 20th, 2017, Donald J. Trump was elected as the 45th President of the United States. This marked the end of a brutal and contentious campaign. He goes in as one of the most unpopular presidents in modern history(based on the popular vote).
The Inauguration and the Women's March
Trump's election to the presidency led to the organization of the Women's March , where millions of men and women took to the streets to protest the new government's stance on women's rights and healthcare. Social media blew up with searchable terms like ""#WomensMarch"" prompting major news organizations to cover the mass protests.
Data Acquisition
The data was acquired using the twitteR package's searchTwitter() function. This function makes a call to the Twitter API. A total of 30000 tweets containing #Inauguration and #WomensMarch were obtained (15000 for each).

Raspberry Turk Project,Large collection of overhead images of chess pieces used to train Raspberry Pi,joeymeyer,5,"Version 1,2017-03-15",artificial intelligence,Other,17 MB,CC4,"1,864 views",80 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/joeymeyer/raspberryturk,"Context
This dataset was created as part of the Raspberry Turk project. The Raspberry Turk is a robot that can play chess‚Äîit's entirely open source, based on Raspberry Pi, and inspired by the 18th century chess playing machine, the Mechanical Turk. The dataset was used to train models for the vision portion of the project.
Content
In the raw form the dataset contains 312 480x480 images of chessboards with their associated board FENs. Each chessboard contains 30 empty squares, 8 orange pawns, 2 orange knights, 2 orange bishops, 2 orange rooks, 2 orange queens, 1 orange king, 8 green pawns, 2 green knights, 2 green bishops, 2 green rooks, 2 green queens, and 1 green king arranged in different random positions.
Scripts for Data Processing
The Raspberry Turk source code includes several scripts for converting this raw data to a more usable form.
To get started download the raw.zip file below and then:
$ git clone git@github.com:joeymeyer/raspberryturk.git
$ cd raspberryturk
$ unzip ~/Downloads/raw.zip -d data
$ conda env create -f data/environment.yml
$ source activate raspberryturk
From this point there are two scripts you will need to run. First, convert the raw data to an interim form (individual 60x60 rgb/grayscale images) using process_raw.py like this:
$ python -m raspberryturk.core.data.process_raw data/raw/ data/interim/
This will split the raw images into individual squares and put them in labeled folders inside the interim folder. The final step is to convert the images into a dataset that can be loaded into a numpy array for training/validation. The create_dataset.py utility accomplishes this. The tool takes a number of parameters that can be used to customize the dataset (ex. choose the labels, rgb/grayscale, zca whiten images first, include rotated images, etc). Below is the documentation for create_dataset.py.
$ python -m raspberryturk.core.data.create_dataset --help
usage: raspberryturk/core/data/create_dataset.py [-h] [-g] [-r] [-s SAMPLE]

Here are just some questions!
In which period of the year do congressmen spend more? Is there a relation between spending and session attendance patterns? Which party spends more, in average, in each of the 27 states? In average, which are the top spenders? Do congressmen spend more on their birthdays? Which professions are associated with most spending? Does education level relates with spending patterns? What is the relation between spending patterns and congressmen profile characteristics?"

When I was a kid i loved RollerCoaster Tycoon. I recently found out that Atari had ported the classic game for iOS, and I immediately purchased it. Now I play whenever I get a free moment. Usually I manage to play a few games a week while I watch TV or listen to podcasts.
If you do not know, a main aspect of the game involves designing custom roller coasters. When you build something new, you can go to a special window to view the ride statistics:
The most important metrics are at the top: You want to maximize excitement without making the ride too intense or nauseating.
When I was a kid I had no patience for numbers (I created rides for maximum awesomeness), but these days I'm fond of that sort of thing. After I completed a few park scenarios, I began to wonder If i can use my own data to build better roller coasters. So I started saving my ride stats in a spreadsheet: After completing each scenario, I just logged the stats from each ride into the spreadsheet. This repository contains that data, as well as any analyses I might conduct on it.
The Data
I still play a few games a week (duh), so occasionally I will update the database with my future creations (feel free to send me your own!). Each ride is cataloged based on the info from the window above:
park_id: Integer. Unique park identifier, zero-indexed.
theme: String. Title of the park scenario.
rollercoaster_type: String. Category of roller coaster.
custom_design: Boolean. True/False on whether I designed the ride, or if it was pre-designed.
excitement: Float. Ride excitement from 0 (very low) with no specified maximum, but it is very rarely above 10.0. Larger numbers are always better.
intensity: Float. Ride intensity from 0 (very dull) with no specified maximum, though most (well-designed) rides are under 10.0. Each customer has their own intensity preference.
nausea: Float. Ride nausea from 0 (very low) with no specified maximum, but lower is better and rides rarely have values above 10.0.
excitement_rating, intensity_rating, `nausea_rating: String. Descriptors of the excitement, intensity, and nausea ratings.
max_speed: Integer. Maximum speed (mph).
avg_speed: Integer. Average speed (mph).
ride_time: Integer. Total duration of the ride in seconds.
ride_length: Integer. Length of the ride in feet.
max_pos_gs, max_neg_gs, max_lateral_gs: Float. Values describing the maximum observed positive, negative, and lateral G-Forces.
total_air_time: Float. Number of seconds in which riders experience weightlessness.
drops: Integer. Number of downhill segments.
highest_drop_height: Integer. Highest height (with 0 being sea-level?) from which a drop takes place. Note: rides can drop to -6 in the game.
inversions: Integer. Number of times riders are upside-down during the ride. This accounts for loops, corkscrews, etc. values of -1 indicate missing information (see caveat #2).
Caveats
So far I've only been keeping track of roller coasters, so the data does not include customizable thrill rides or water rides (excepting the Dinghy Slide, which is classified as a roller coaster in the game).
It is unfortunate that the first handful of rides I built did not have any inversions, and it took me several weeks to realize that the game does not show this info unless there are inversions. During that time, I simply ignored the inversions count, so we just do not have that info for many rides. Some rides cannot have inversions, and I filled in that information after the fact. So, a value for inversions = -1 indicates that the ride could have had inversions."

Description
It has now been more than 12 years that the Mars Express Orbiter (MEX) provides science data from Mars about its ionosphere and ground subsurface composition. The 3D imagery of Mars has provided the community with unprecedented information about the planet. Today, thanks to the work of careful and expert operators, Mars Express Orbiter still provides information that supports ground exploration missions on Mars (Curiosity, Opportunity, ...) and a lot of other research.
The Mars Express Orbiter is operated by the European Space Agency from its operations centre (Darmstadt, Germany) where all the telemetry is analysed. The health status of the spacecraft is carefully monitored to plan future science observations and to avoid power shortages.
Operators of Mars Express keep track of the thermal power consumption thanks to the telemetry data. The spacecraft uses electric power coming from the solar arrays (or batteries, during eclipses) not only to supply power to the platform units, but also to the thermal subsystem, which keeps the entire spacecraft within its operating temperature range. The remaining available power can be used by the payloads to do science operations:
SciencePower = ProducedPower ‚àí PlatformPower ‚àí ThermalPower
The Mars Express Power Challenge focuses on the difficult problem of predicting the thermal power consumption. Three full Martian years of Mars Express telemetry are made available and you are challenged to predict the thermal subsystem power consumption on the following Martian year. If successful, the winning method will be a new tool helping the Mars Express Orbiter deliver science data for a longer period of time.
more details on the data could be found there: https://kelvins.esa.int/mars-express-power-challenge/

Active Volcanoes in the Philippines,23 active volcanoes >,Gabriel Joshua Miguel,5,"Version 1,2017-05-09",,CSV,2 KB,Other,976 views,33 downloads,,,https://www.kaggle.com/gabbygab/active-volcanoes-in-the-philippines,"Context
Active volcanoes in the Philippines, as categorized by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS), include volcanoes in the country having erupted within historical times (within the last 600 years), with accounts of these eruptions documented by humans; or having erupted within the last 10,000 years (holocene) based on analyses of datable materials. However, there is no consensus among volcanologists on how to define an ""active"" volcano. As of 2012, PHIVOLCS lists 23 volcanoes as active in the Philippines, 21 of which have historical eruptions; one, Cabalian, which is strongly fumarolic volcano[further explanation needed]; and one, Leonard Kniaseff, which was active 1,800 years ago (C14).
There are 50 Philippines volcanoes listed by the royal Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program (GVP) at present,of which 20 are categorized as ""historical"" and 59 as ""Holocene"".The GVP lists volcanoes with historical, Holocene eruptions, or possibly older if strong signs of volcanism are still evident through thermal features like fumaroles, hot springs, mud pots, etc.

The newspaper publications on the Internet increases every day. There are many news agencies, newspapers and magazines with digital publications on the big network. Published documents made available to users who, in turn, use search engines to find them. To deliver the closest searched documents, these documents must be previously indexed and classified. With the huge volume of documents published every day, many researches have been carried out in order to find a way of dealing with the automatic document classification.
Content
The ""Tribuna"" database is of journalistic origin with its digital publication, a factor that may be important for professionals of the area, also serving to understand other similar datasets. In order to carry out the experiment, we adopted the ""A Tribuna"" database, whose main characteristics presented previously, show that the collection is a good source of research, since it is already classified by specialists and has 21 classes that can be Displayed in the table below.

2015 Global Open Data Index,What is the state of open data around the world?,Open Knowledge International,5,"Version 1,2017-03-04",research,CSV,257 KB,CC0,"2,200 views",264 downloads,8 kernels,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/okfn/open-data,"Context
The Global Open Data Index is an annual effort to measure the state of open government data around the world. The crowdsourced survey is designed to assess the openness of specific government datasets according to the Open Definition.
The Global Open Data Index is not an official government representation of the open data offering in each country, but an independent assessment from a citizen‚Äôs perspective. It is a civil society audit of open data, and it enables government progress on open data by giving them a measurement tool and a baseline for discussion and analysis of the open data ecosystem in their country and internationally from a key user‚Äôs perspective.
The Global Open Data Index plays a powerful role in sustaining momentum for open data around the world and in convening civil society networks to use and collaborate around this data. Governments and open data practitioners can review the index results to see how accessible the open data they publish actually appears to their citizens, see where improvements are necessary to make open data truly open and useful, and track their progress year to year.
According to the common open data assessment framework there are four different ways to evaluate data openess ‚Äî context, data, use and impact. The Global Open Data Index is intentionally narrowly focused on the data aspect, hence, limiting its inquiry only to the datasets publication by national governments. It does not look at the broader societal context, seek to assess use or impact in a systematic way, or evaluate the quality of the data. This narrow focus of data publication enables it to provide a standardized, robust, comparable assessment of the state of the publication of key data by governments around the world.

Slums and informal settlements detection,Use satellite imagery and machine learning to help fight against poverty.,Federico Bayl√©,5,"Version 1,2017-07-13",,Other,323 MB,ODbL,470 views,26 downloads,,,https://www.kaggle.com/fedebayle/slums-argentina,"Context
This datasets comes from a personal project that begun with my MSc thesis in Data Mining at Buenos Aires University. There I detect slums and informal settlements for La Matanza (Buenos Aires) district. The algorithm developed there helps to reduce to 15% of the total territory to analyze.
After successfully finish the thesis, I created a map of slums for whole Argentina. Map and thesis content are available at fedebayle.github.io/potencialesvya.
As far as I know, this is the first research of its kind in Argentina, which I think would help my country to contribute to UN Millennium Development Goal 7, Target 11, ""Improving the lives of 100 million slum dwellers"".
Content
This datasets contains georeferenced images about urban slums and informal settlements for two districts in Argentina: Buenos Aires and C√≥rdoba (~ 15M habitants).
The image of Cordoba was taken on 2017-06-09 and the images of Buenos Aires on 2017-05-04.
Each image comes from Sentinel-2 sensor, with 32x32px and 4 bands (bands 2, 3, 4, 8A, 10 meter resolution). Those who prefix is ""vya_"" contains slums (positive class). Sentinel-2 is an Earth observation mission developed by ESA as part of the Copernicus Programme to perform terrestrial observations in support of services such as forest monitoring, land cover changes detection, and natural disaster management.
Images are in .tif format.
Image names consist of:
(vya_)[tile id]_[raster row start]_[raster row end]_[raster column start]_[raster column end].tif
This is a highly imbalanced class problem:
C√≥rdoba: 37 of 13,004 images corresponds to slums.
Buenos Aires: 1,008 of 46,047 images corresponds to slums.
Acknowledgements
I would not have been able to create this dataset if the Sentinel program did not exist. Thanks to European Space Agency!
Inspiration
The cost of conducting a survey of informal settlements and slums is high and requires copious logistical resources. In Argentina, these surveys have been conducted only each 10 years at census.
Algorithms developed with this data could be used in different countries and help to fight poverty around the world."

- Curtis
Context
New York City Speed Limits
The New York Department of Transportation Regulates the speed limits for its roads (Afterall, we can't be hitting 88 MPH on a regular day). This dataset describes the speed limits for particular road segments of New York City streets.
The New York City Centerline
Which streets are inherently faster? How will speed limits come into play? How will nearby bike lanes slow down vehicles (and ultimately taxis)? These are the kinds of questions that can only be answered with contextual data of the streets themselves.
Fortunately, most major cities provide a public Centerline file that describes the path of all railroads, ferry routes, and streets in the city. I've taken the New York City Centerline and packaged a dataset that tries to extract meaning out of all the road connections within the city.
Content
New York City Speed Limits
Every speed limit region is a straight line. (Which represents a segment of road). These lines are expressed by two pairs of coordinates.
lat1 - The first latitude coord
lon1 - The first longitude coord
lat2 - The second latitude coord
lat2 - The second longitude coord
street - The name of the street the speed limit is imposed on
speed - The speed limit of that road section
signed - Denotes if there is a physical sign on the street that displays the speed limit to cars.
region - The city region that the road resides in. There are 5 regions: (Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island)
distance - The length of the speed limit road section (in Miles).
The New York City Centerline
street - The name of the street
post_type* - The extension for the street name.
st_width - The width of the street (in feet). There are varying widths for the size of a street so it was hard to derive a lane count/ street using this feature. As a rule of thumb, the average lane is around 12 feet wide.
bike_lane - Defines which segments are part of the bicycle network as defined by the NYC Department of Transportation. There are 11 classes:
1 = Class I
2 = Class II
3 = Class III
4 = Links
5 = Class I, II
6 = Class II, III
7 = Stairs
8 = Class I, III
9 = Class II, I
10 = Class III, I
11 = Class III, II
Bike class information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_in_New_York_City#Bikeway_types
bike_traf_dir** - Describes the direction of traffic: (FT = With, TF = Against, TW = Two-Way)
traf_dir** - Describes the direction of traffic: (FT = With, TF = Against, TW = Two-Way)
rw_type - The type of road. There are 6 types of roads: (1 = Street, 2 = Highway, 3 = Bridge, 4 = Tunnel, 9 = Ramp, 13 = U-Turn). Note: I parsed awkward path types such as ""Ferry route"" and ""trail"".
start_contour*** - Numeric value indicating the vertical position of the feature's ""from"" node relative to grade level.
end_contour*** - Numeric value indicating the vertical position of the feature's ""to"" node relative to grade level.
snow_pri - The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) snow removal priority designation.
V = Non-DSNY
C = Critical (These streets have top priority)
S = Sector (These streets are second priority)
H = Haulster (Small spreaders with plows attached for treating areas with limited accessibility - can hold two tons of salt)
region - The city region that the road resides in. There are 5 regions: (Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island)
length - The length of the road (in Miles).
points - The coordinates that define the road. Each coordinate is separated by '|' and the lat and lon values per coordinate are separated by ';'. (Side note: Round road sections are plotted by points along the curve).
*For those who may not be aware, road names are based on a convention. ""Avenue""s, ""Boulevard""s, and ""Road""s are different for distinct reasons. I left these fields in the dataset in case you wish to find any patterns that are pertinent to those types of roads. To learn more about road conventions, visit this link: http://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/in-naming-streets-strict-rules-dictate-roads-rises-trails-and-more
**To explain how direction works I'll provide you with an image: http://imgur.com/a/UflwX. Think of every road on the centerline as a vector. It points from one location to another. It always points from the very first coordinate to the very last coordinate. Now pay attention to the direction of the road (circled). Note how it points in the same direction as the vector denoted by the centerline data. The ""traf_dir"" attribute of the street is ""FT"" because the vector is headed in the same direction as traffic is (it is a one-way street). For ""traf_dir"" with a value of ""TW"", the direction of the vector doesn't matter as the road is a two-way street.
***I've had little luck finding what the ""grade levels"" represent. The original aliases are ""TO_LVL_CO"" and ""FRM_LVL_CO"". I'll keep searching tonight and will try to dig up what elevation these grades represent. I highly suspect the grades are contour lines because I know they have some relevance to elevation. In the meantime here are the ""grades"" that each value represents:
1 = Below Grade 1
2 = Below Grade 2
3 = Below Grade 3
4 = Below Grade 4
5 = Below Grade 5
6 = Below Grade 6
7 = Below Grade 7
8 = Below Grade 8
9 = Below Grade 9
10 = Below Grade 10
11 = Below Grade 11
12 = Below Grade 12
13 = At Grade
14 = Above Grade 1
15 = Above Grade 2
16 = Above Grade 3
17 = Above Grade 4
18 = Above Grade 5
19 = Above Grade 6
20 = Above Grade 7
21 = Above Grade 8
22 = Above Grade 9
23 = Above Grade 10
24 = Above Grade 11
25 = Above Grade 12
26 = Above Grade 13
99 = Not Applicable

In machine learning there is a long path from understanding to intuition. I have created many data files of traditional electronics test pattern to see the response of different activation, loss, optimizers, and metrics in Keras. These files should give some ability to test drive your chosen type of machine learning with a very deliberate data set.
I wanted something that was infinitely predicable to see how all the different settings effected the algorithms to set a base line for me to gain intuition as to how they should behave once I make more complex models.

The data was aggregated at the site http://tzeva-adom.com.
Inspiration
Israel has a system called ""Iron Dome"" which intercepts rockets(But only from certain distance). The challenge for Israel is where those systems should be deployed and at what times. Furthermore, it will be interesting to find patterns in the times rockets were being launched, trying to see if different places were targeted in different times of day. Also, areas that were targeted at the same time find if it's possible to cluster the places into different groups of areas.
Operation ""Protective Edge"" took place from 8 July until 26 August 2014. After it ended, The rocket attack ended (more or less) until today(June 2017). It will be interesting to check out how the operation effects the alerts, the launching patterns, targeted areas, etc.
Though the names in this dataset are in Hebrew, no Hebrew knowledge is needed for working with this dataset. I tried to find an appropriate automatic transliteration service to English, but non of them proved useful. If anyone knows how to get them in English, even using some list from the internet of the cities names in English and their corresponding Hebrew names, I'll appreciate your contribution to the dataset's GitHub repository:

Overview ABSTRACT The 2010/11 Integrated Household Living Conditions Survey or EICV3 (Enqu√™te Int√©grale sur les Conditions de Vie des M√©nages) is the third in the series of surveys which started in 2000/01 and is designed to monitor poverty and living conditions in Rwanda. The survey methodology has changed little over its 10 years, making it ideal for monitoring changes in the country. In 2010/11, for the first time the achieved sample size of 14,308 households in the EICV3 was sufficient to provide estimates which are reliable at the level of the district.
KIND OF DATA Sample survey data [ssd]
UNITS OF ANALYSIS For the purposes of this study, the following units of analysis are considered:
-communities
-households
-persons
Scope NOTES The scope of survey is defined by the need to evaluate poverty determinants and effects of poverty in various domains. This includes gathering data in specific sectors and examning summary statistics and computed indicators by consumption indicator, gender etc. The survey primarily seeks to compute household consumption aggregates and correlate consumption to the following areas are within the scope and integrated into the survey:
Education (education expenditures): general education, curriculum, vocational training and, higher learning, school-leaving, literacy and apprenticeship.
Health (health expenditures): disability and health problems, general health and preventative vaccination over the past 12 months.
Migration (travel expenditures): rural-urban migration, internal and external migration.
Housing (expenditures on utilities, rent etc.): status of the housing occupancy, services and installations, physical characteristics of the dwelling, access and satisfaction towards basic services.
Economic activity (revenue): unemployment, underemployment and job search, occupation, wage or salaried employment characteristics, VUP Activities, all other activities, domestic work.
Non-agricultural activities (revenue): activity status, formal and informal sector activity.
Agriculture (income and expenditure) : livestock, land and agricultural equipment, details of holding parcels/blocs and agricultural policy changes, crop harvests and use on a large and small scale crop production, harvests and use, transformation (processing) of agricultural products.
In addition to the specific sector information, consumption and/or wealth holding information was collected:
Consumption: Expenditure on non food items, food expenditure, subsistence farming (own consumption) with different recall periods.
Other cash flows : transfers out by household, transfers received by the household, income support programs & other revenues (excluding all incomes accrued from saving), VUP, UBUDEHE & RSSP schemes, other expenditure (excluding expenditures related to any form of saving).
Stock items: credit, durable assets and savings (household assets and liabilities)

"Vehicle and Tire Recalls, 1967-Present",What manufacturer has recalled the most vehicles in the past fifty years?,NHTSA,5,"Version 1,2017-02-07",automobiles,CSV,19 MB,CC0,"2,424 views",250 downloads,5 kernels,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/nhtsa/safety-recalls,"Context
The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (1966) gives the Department of Transportation‚Äôs National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) the authority to issue vehicle safety standards and to require manufacturers to recall vehicles that have safety-related defects or do not meet federal safety standards. More than 390 million cars, trucks, buses, recreational vehicles, motorcycles, and mopeds, 46 million tires, 66 million pieces of motor vehicle equipment, and 42 million child safety seats have been recalled to correct safety defects since 1967.
Manufacturers voluntarily initiate many of these recalls, while others are influenced by NHTSA investigations or ordered by NHTSA via the courts. If a safety defect is discovered, the manufacturer must notify NHTSA, vehicle or equipment owners, dealers, and distributors. The manufacturer is then required to remedy the problem at no charge to the owner. NHTSA is responsible for monitoring the manufacturer‚Äôs corrective action to ensure successful completion of the recall campaign.

California Wire Tapping,Investigate ~$30M dollars of wiretapping in the Electronic Interceptions Reports,Electronic Frontier Foundation,5,"Version 1,2017-06-13",crime,Other,16 MB,Other,"1,269 views",94 downloads,5 kernels,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/eff/california-wire-tapping,"Context
In 2016, California investigators used state wiretapping laws 563 times to capture 7.8 million communications from 181,000 people, and only 19% of these communications were incriminating. The year's wiretaps cost nearly $30 million.
We know this, and much more, now that the California Department of Justice (CADOJ) for the first time has released to EFF the dataset underlying its annual wiretap report to the state legislature.
Content
The yearly ‚ÄúElectronic Interceptions Report‚Äù includes county-by-county granular data on wiretaps on landlines, cell phones, computers, pagers1, and other devices. Each interception is accompanied by information on the number of communications captured and the number of people those communications involved, as well as what percentage of the messages were incriminating. The report also discloses the criminal justice outcomes of the wiretaps (e.g. drugs seized, arrests made) and the costs to the public for running each surveillance operation.
Under California‚Äôs sunshine law, government agencies must provide public records to requesters in whatever electronic format they may exist. And yet, for the last three years, CADOJ officials resisted releasing the data in a machine-readable format. In fact, in 2015, CADOJ initially attempted to only release the ‚Äúlocked‚Äù version of a PDF of the report until EFF publicly called out the agency for ignoring these provisions of the California Public Records Act.
EFF sought the dataset because the formatting of the paper version of the report was extremely difficult to scrape or export in a way that would result in reliable and accurate data. Tables in the reports have sometimes spanned more than 70 pages.
This year, EFF has scored a major victory for open data: in response to our latest request, CADOJ has released not only an unlocked PDF, but a spreadsheet containing all the data.
What‚Äôs especially interesting about the data is that it includes data not previously disclosed in the formal report, including information on when wiretaps targeted multiple locations, devices, and websites, such as Facebook. At the same time, the data does not include some information included in the official report, such as the narrative summary of the outcome of each wiretap.
Inspiration
Some of the highlights contained in the data.
Wiretap application in Riverside County dropped from 620 wiretap applications in 2015 to 106 in 2016. This is likely due to reforms in the Riverside County District Attorney‚Äôs office following a series of investigative reports from USA Today that showed many wiretaps were likely illegal.
As in previous years, many of the wiretaps captured voluminous amounts of communications from large groups of people. The largest in terms of communications was a wiretap in a Los Angeles narcotics case in which 559,000 communications were captured from cell phones over 30 days. The largest in terms of number of people were caught up in a wiretap was a Riverside narcotics case in which 91,000 people each had a single piece of communication captured over 120 days.
The most expensive wiretap cost $1 million, mostly in personnel costs, to target a single person‚Äôs text message in a Los Angeles murder case. The most expensive wiretap in terms of non-personnel resources (i.e. equipment) cost $193,000. Two arrests were made in the associated narcotics case.

Hypernymy,Pairs of terms annotated to whether one is a hypernym of the other,Vered Shwartz,5,"Version 1,2017-08-13",,CSV,2 MB,GPL,497 views,58 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/vered1986/hypernymy,"Context
Hypernymy is an important lexical-semantic relation for NLP tasks. For instance, knowing that Tom Cruise is an actor can help a question answering system answer the question ""which actors are involved in Scientology?"". While semantic taxonomies, like WordNet define hypernymy relations between word types, they are limited in scope and domain. Therefore, automated methods have been developed to determine, for a given term-pair (x, y), whether y is an hypernym of x, based on their occurrences in a large corpus. To facilitate training neural methods for hypernymy detection, which typically require a large amount of training data, we followed the common methodology of creating a dataset using distant supervision from knowledge resources, and extracted hypernymy relations from WordNet, DBPedia, Wikidata, and Yago.
Content
All instances in our dataset, both positive and negative, are pairs of terms that are directly related in at least one of the resources. These resources contain thousands of relations, some of which indicate hypernymy with varying degrees of certainty. To avoid including questionable relation types, we consider as denoting positive examples only indisputable hypernymy relations (Table 1), which we manually selected from the set of hypernymy indicating relations in Shwartz et al. (2015).
Term-pairs related by other relations (including hyponymy), are considered as negative instances, and there is a ratio of 1:4 positive to negative pairs in the dataset.

Table 1: hypernymy relations in each resource.
We provide two dataset splits: random - 70/25/5 ratio for train/test/validation, and lexical - where each set has a distinct vocabulary, preventing models from overfitting to the most common class of x/y (this split maintains a similar ratio).
Files:
train_rnd.csv, test_rnd.csv, val_rnd.csv - the training, test, and validation set of the random split.
train_lex.csv, test_lex.csv, val_lex.csv - the training, test, and validation set of the lexical split.

Proper-names Categories,Is-A relation between a name (e.g. Lady Gaga) and a common noun (e.g. singer),Vered Shwartz,5,"Version 1,2017-08-13",,CSV,78 KB,GPL,528 views,59 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/vered1986/propernames-categories,"Context
Recognizing lexical inference is an important component in semantic tasks. Various lexical semantic relations, such as synonomy, class membership, part-of, and causality may be used to infer the meaning of one word from another, in order to address lexical variability.
As many of the existing lexical inference datasets are constructed from WordNet, important linguistic components that are missing from them are proper-names (Lady Gaga) and recent terminology (social networks). This dataset contains both components.
To construct the dataset, we sampled articles from different topics in online magazines. As candidate (x, y) pairs, we extracted pairs of noun phrases x and y that belonged to the same paragraph in the original text, selecting those in which x is a proper-name. These pairs were manually annotated. To balance the ratio of positive and negative pairs in the dataset, we sampled negative examples according to the frequency of y in positive pairs, creating ""harder"" negative examples, such as (Sherlock, lady) and (Kylie Minogue, vice president).
Content
This dataset contains pairs of (x, y) terms in which x is a proper-name and y is a common noun, annotated to whether x is a y. For instance, (Lady Gaga, singer) is true, but (Lady Gaga, film) is false.

Unimorph,Morphological annotation for 352 languages,Rachael Tatman,5,"Version 1,2017-08-12",linguistics,Other,1 GB,CC4,769 views,53 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/unimorph,"Context:
The fact that some languages extensively use suffixes and prefixes to convey grammatical meaning(e.g. subject-verb agreement) poses a challenge to most current human language technology (HLT). Suffixes and prefixes in such languages can more generally be called morphemes, which are defined as the meaningful subparts of words. The rules that languages use to combine morphemes, together with the actual morphemes that they use (i.e. suffixes and prefixes themselves), are both referred to as a language's morphology. Languages which make extensive use of morphemes to build words are said to be morphologically-rich. These include languages such as Turkish and can be contrasted with so-called analytic languages such as Mandarin Chinese, which does not use suffixes or prefixes all.
The goal of the Universal Morphological Feature Schema is to allow an inflected word from any language to be dened by its lexical meaning (typically carried in the root or stem) and by a rendering of its inflectional morphemes in terms of features from the schema (i.e. a vector of universal morphological features). When an inflected word is defined in this way, it can then be translated into any other language since all other inflected words from all other languages can also be defined in terms of the Universal Morphological Feature Schema. Although building an interlingual representation for the semantic content of human language as a whole is typically seen as prohibitively difficult, the comparatively small extent of grammatical meanings that are conveyed by overt, affixal inflectional morphology places a natural bound on the range of meaning that must be expressed by an interlingua for inflectional morphology.
Content:
This dataset contains Unimorph morphological annotations for 352 languages. Each language‚Äôs annotations are in a separate file, and each file has a different number of words.
Many cells in each file are empty. This is because not every feature that is annotated applies to every part of speech. Nouns, for example, do not have a tense. In addition, not every language makes use of every possible morphological marking. For instance, English does not have an evidentiality inflection, while other languages, like Mongolian and Eastern Pomo, do.

Internal Navigation Dataset,Figure out a way to navigate accurately with your wireless network data,leigh,5,"Version 1,2017-08-11",navigation,CSV,3 KB,Other,871 views,51 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/ljewell/internal-navigation-dataset,"Context
Global Positioning Systems (GPS) available in many consumer products such as mobile phones has mostly solved the problem of navigation but remains a challenge for indoor locations. A possible solution exists with 802.11 wireless networks and Location Based Services (LBS) that are able to compute location of a Wireless Station (WS) using triangulation of telemetry such as Receiver Signal Strength Indicators (RSSI) from nearby Wireless Access Points (WAP). The WS coordinates have inaccuracies due to it being ‚Äúa function of distance, geometry, and materials‚Äù (Mengual, Marb√°n & Eibe, 2010) making distance travelled calculation inaccurate. In an experiment plotting a moving workstation the estimated distanced travelled was 483 metres compared to the actual distance of 149 metres (322% difference).
Content
The LBS system receives data from the wireless network, computes location information for each workstation and stores the data for later retrieval. The data can be sourced from the LBS using an REST API that returns JSON formatted data. To enable comparison to the estimated calculation, a controlled experiment with a wireless station moving to 20 known locations and turning on the wireless interface for 90 sec periods at a time was conducted.
The continual stream of coordinates from the LBS can change not only due to the WS physically moving but also due to the errors in the location calculation itself. These errors can be significant and render any distance calculation meaningless. The experiment captured the calculated position from the wireless network and the actual measured x and y coordinates of a workstation in 20 locations in an office building. The challenge is to figure out using the wireless location ways to improve the accuracy of the prediction.

Author Disambiguation,Practice disambiguation with this batch of research paper metadata,AMiner,5,"Version 1,2017-08-11",,{}JSON,23 MB,Other,716 views,41 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/aminer/author-disambiguation,"Name ambiguity has long been viewed as a challenging problem in many applications, such as scientific literature management, people search, and social network analysis. When we search a person name in these systems, many documents (e.g., papers, webpages) containing that person‚Äôs name may be returned. Which documents are about the person we care about? Although much research has been conducted, the problem remains largely unsolved, especially with the rapid growth of the people information available on the Web.
Content
This data set contains 110 author names and their disambiguation results (ground truth). For each author, there are 3 json entries. The most important files are xxx_xml, xxx(classify)_txt, and xxx_txt. The xxx(classify)_txt contains the ground truth and the other two files (xxx_xml and xxx_txt) provide features to perform the disambiguation. At the high-level, the xxx_xml file includes title, venue, coauthor, affiliation, and the xxx.txt further contains citation, co-affiliation-occur and homepage.
Let us use ""Ajay Gupta"" as the example to explain what information contained in each file.
Ajay Gupta.xml. The raw file. is formatted as a XML file. In the XML file, the author name is associated with a number of publications. An example of a publication is as follow: "" Explanation-based Failure Recovery 1987 Ajay Gupta AAAI 13048 0 null "" where denotes the title of the publication; denotes the publication year; denotes the publication venue; denotes the publication id; denotes the labeled person, e.g., all publications with ""0"" can be considered as published by the same person; denotes the affiliation of the author(s).
Ajay Gupta(classify).txt: the answer file is the ground truth. It is actually extracted from the raw-file by viewing publications with the same ""0"" as a person. The format is in plain text. The following is an example: "" Ajay Gupta -1:13048 388794 596099 1265282 1179332 675629 39153 258611 -2:988870 1490190 -3:1393934 -4:1398544 -5:1739014 -6:1671104 515636 1678096 -7:1126381 1205032 275987 277587 276300 1549674 1034401 -8:600181 846439 149270 175996 264268 264291 299548 1384744 300057 302056 545651 1212517 -9:1316053 "" where the first line denotes the author name and each of the following line indicates a disambiguated person. For example the first line indicates that an author published 8 papers. The corresponding IDs of those papers are respectively 13048, 388794, 596099, 1265282, 1179332, 675629, 39153, 258611.
Ajay Gupta.txt: the intermediate feature files. It contains 8 matrices, which respectively represents 8 features: co-affiliation, coauthor, citation, co-venue, google (ignored), co-affiliation-occur, titleSim, homepage. Each matrix records the correlation between any two papers published by Ajay Gupta. Each element, e.g., m^0_{ij}, the i-th row and the j-column in the 0-th matrix, denotes whether the two papers (i and j) contain the same affiliation. In this sense, the problem of name disambiguation can be basically considered as a pairwise clustering problem. The second matrix records the number of same coauthors, except Ajay Gupta. The third matrix records whether the a paper cites another paper. The fourth matrix records whether a paper is published at the same venue with another paper. The fifth matrix records whether the two papers (titles) can be found at a same web page (e.g., conference page). (This matrix is not complete). The sixth matrix records whether the affiliation of author ""a"" of a paper appears in the content of another paper, or vice versa. The seventh matrix records the cosine similarity between titles of any two papers. The eighth matrix records whether two papers appear on the same homepage. Please note that the 5th-8th matrixes cannot be extracted from the raw-data file (xxx.xml) and they are generated using other program.

Currently, this collection includes over eighty titles that were digitized with special funding from the Chancellor and the University Library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The Southern United States has been a distinct region since the colonial period, and its literature has developed in connection with, but also divergently from American literature as a whole. The South claims prominent and world-renowned authors, including Edgar Allan Poe and Mark Twain, but also lesser known authors who created works that reflected Southern attitudes and experiences. Teachers of literature as well as historians and other scholars of Southern culture need access to literary texts that illustrate these differences, and many of these important Southern works are no longer in print and are not widely held in libraries. Noting this lack of available titles, the late Dr. Robert Bain volunteered to help Documenting the American South by developing the bibliography for it. Dr. Bain was a faculty member at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and taught American and Southern literature from 1964 until 1995. He also co-edited five scholarly works on Southern writers. To prepare this bibliography of Southern Literature, Dr. Bain wrote to some fifty scholars throughout the United States who specialize in Southern and American literature requesting that they nominate what they considered to be the ten most important works of Southern literature published before 1920. From their responses, Dr. Bain compiled the bibliography on which this collection is based. He completed the list three months before his death in July 1996. With additional funding from the University Library, this collection continues to grow. Dr. Joe Flora, professor of English at UNC-Chapel Hill, guides the expansion of this collection beyond Dr. Bain's original bibliography. The original texts for the ""Library of Southern Literature"" come from the University Library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which includes the Southern Historical Collection, one of the largest collections of Southern manuscripts in the country and the North Carolina Collection, the most complete printed documentation of a single state anywhere. The DocSouth Editorial Board, composed of faculty and librarians at UNC and staff from the UNC Press, oversees this collection and all other collections on Documenting the American South.

The North American Slave Narratives collection at the University of North Carolina contains 344 items and is the most extensive collection of such documents in the world.
The physical collection was digitized and transcribed by students and library employees. This means that the text is far more reliable than uncorrected OCR output which is common in digitized archives.
More information about the collection and access to individual page images can be be found here: http://docsouth.unc.edu/neh
The plain text files have been optimized for use in Voyant and can also be used in text mining projects such as topic modeling, sentiment analysis and natural language processing. Please note that the full text contains paratextual elements such as title pages and appendices which will be included in any word counts you perform. You may wish to delete these in order to focus your analysis on just the narratives.
The .csv file acts as a table of contents for the collection and includes Title, Author, Publication Date a url pointing to the digitized version of the text and a unique url pointing to a version of the text in plain text (this is particularly useful for use with Voyant: http://voyant-tools.org/).

About the DocSouth Data Project
Doc South Data provides access to some of the Documenting The American South collections in formats that work well with common text mining and data analysis tools.
Documenting the American South is one of the longest running digital publishing initiatives at the University of North Carolina. It was designed to give researchers digital access to some of the library‚Äôs unique collections in the form of high quality page scans as well as structured, corrected and machine readable text.
Doc South Data is an extension of this original goal and has been designed for researchers who want to use emerging technology to look for patterns across entire texts or compare patterns found in multiple texts. We have made it easy to use tools such as Voyant (http://voyant-tools.org/) to conduct simple word counts and frequency visualizations (such as word clouds) or to use other tools to perform more complex processes such as topic modeling, named-entity recognition or sentiment analysis."

Users were heavily rate-limited in their ability to place pixels, so this dataset shows what happens when users of similar stripes ""band together"" to build something greater than themselves. With a pixel-by-pixel history, what can you tell about the relative popularity of different regions in the figure? Can you use image analysis techniques to segment the image into different regions, and measure what happens to them over time?"

Top Ranked English Movies Of This Decade.,Understanding the success of movies with high ratings.,Sai Pranav,5,"Version 2,2017-11-30|Version 1,2017-08-27","film
entertainment",CSV,86 KB,CC4,"1,825 views",289 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/saipranava/top-ranked-enlglish-movies-of-this-decade,"About this project
This is my first pet project ever. In this project I'm going to do exploratory analysis on the top rated IMDb movies of all time. I wanted to analyse the the box office success of a highly rated movie and its relationship with various variables like, the age, gender of user/voter. For this purpose I looked at the top 100 Movies of all time on IMDb. I used Octoparse for scraping.
I realized that it would be too complicated to analyse movies over various generations, because the tastes of every generation is different, so I narrowed down onto movies of this decade, i.e. movies released between 2010-2016 ) both years included, I know 2010 doesn't really fall in to this decade, but included it in order to have a decent sized data set. Then I narrowed down to movies targeting a particular culture, because Indian movies and American movies are quite different, and trying to predict what people like, with both kinds of movies mixed up didn't seem like a good idea.
I excluded movies released in 2017 as it takes time for ratings to stabilize and box office reports to be finalized.
So from this list, I further shortened the list to movies made in English, and finally ended up with a dataset of 118 movies and 55 variables. One of the most important variable, the box office collections of each movie could not be scraped due to technical difficulties, this is an area I really need help with, so if someone can contribute here, it would be great!
Objectives
What are the goals or questions you're investigating with this project?
Visualize and Analyse the ratings given by different age groups for a genre.
Visualize and Analyse the ratings given by male and female groups for a genre.
Visualize and Analyse the number of votes given by different age groups for a genre.
Visualize and Analyse the number of votes given by male and female groups for a genre.
Visualize and Analyse the Box office success of a movie in U.S. with various variables.
Visualize and Analyse the Box office success of a movie outside the U.S. with various variables.
Visualize and Analyse the overall Box office success of a movie with various variables.
Revisit the project after a couple of years and see if any of the models we built have made any accurate predictions.
Get involved
How can others contribute to this project? Are there tasks that need to be done, or skills you're looking for?
Scrape data to get the U.S. box office data and non-U.S. box office data of each movie. COMPLETED (Check IMDB2.csv)
Integrate that data into our dataset. COMPLETED (Check IMDB2.csv)
Clean the data.
Scrape data to understand how much each of these movies was pirated.

Real Location Retrieval from Text,Location Metonymy Resolution Dataset,Rachael Tatman,5,"Version 1,2017-08-19","geography

This dataset is a Wikipedia-based MR dataset called RelocaR, which is tailored towards locations as well as improving previous defi- ciencies in annotation guidelines. The corpus is designed to evaluate the capability of a classifier to distinguish literal, metonymic and mixed location mentions. In terms of dataset size, ReLocaR contains 1,026 training and 1,000 test instances. The data was sampled using Wikipedia‚Äôs Random Article API. We kept the sentences, which contained at least one of the places from a manually compiled list of countries and capitals of the world. The natural distribution of literal versus metonymic examples is approximately 80/20 so we had to discard the excess literal examples during sampling to balance the classes.
Annotation Guidelines
ReLocaR has three classes, literal, metonymic and mixed. Literal reading comprises territorial interpretations (the geographical territory, the land, soil and physical location) i.e. inanimate places that serve to point to a set of coordinates (where something might be located and/or happening) such as ‚ÄúThe treaty was signed in Italy.‚Äù, ‚ÄúPeter comes from Russia.‚Äù, ‚ÄúBritain‚Äôs Andy Murray won the Grand Slam today.‚Äù, ‚ÄúUS companies increased exports by 50%.‚Äù, ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs artists are among the best in the world.‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe reach of the transmission is as far as Brazil.‚Äù.
A metonymic reading is any location occurrence that expresses animacy (Coulson and Oakley, 2003) such as ‚ÄúJamaica‚Äôs indifference will not improve the negotiations.‚Äù, ‚ÄúSweden‚Äôs budget deficit may rise next year.‚Äù. The following are other metonymic scenarios: a location name, which stands for any persons or organisations associated with it such as ‚ÄúWe will give aid to Afghanistan.‚Äù, a location as a product such as ‚ÄúI really enjoyed that delicious Bordeaux.‚Äù, a location posing as a sports team ‚ÄúIndia beat Pakistan in the playoffs.‚Äù, a governmental or other legal entity posing as a location ‚ÄúZambia passed a new justice law today.‚Äù, events acting as locations ‚ÄúVietnam was a bad experience for me‚Äù.
The mixed reading is assigned in two cases: either both readings are invoked at the same time such as in ‚ÄúThe Central European country of Slovakia recently joined the EU.‚Äù or there is not enough context to ascertain the reading i.e. both are plausible such as in ‚ÄúWe marvelled at the art of ancient Mexico.‚Äù. In difficult cases such as these, the mixed class is assigned.

Six Degrees of Francis Bacon is a digital reconstruction of the early modern social network (EMSN). Historians and literary critics have long studied the way that early modern people associated with each other and participated in various kinds of formal and informal groups. By data-mining existing scholarship that describes relationships between early modern persons, documents, and institutions, we have created a unified, systematized representation of the way people in early modern England were connected.
Contents
This dataset contains information on 171419 relationships between 15824 early modern figures (including, of course, the titular Francis Bacon). The individuals have been separated into 109 distinct labelled groups and the relationships fall under one of 64 labelled categories.
This dataset contains the following files:
SDFB_groups.csv: a list of the groups of individuals in the dataset

Commercial Paper,Rates & Volumes for 1998-2017,Federal Reserve,5,"Version 1,2017-09-19","finance
banking",CSV,1 MB,CC0,"1,207 views",86 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/federalreserve/commercial-paper-rates,"Commercial paper, in the global financial market, is an unsecured promissory note with a fixed maturity of not more than 270 days.
Commercial paper is a money-market security issued (sold) by large corporations to obtain funds to meet short-term debt obligations (for example, payroll), and is backed only by an issuing bank or company promise to pay the face amount on the maturity date specified on the note. Since it is not backed by collateral, only firms with excellent credit ratings from a recognized credit rating agency will be able to sell their commercial paper at a reasonable price. Commercial paper is usually sold at a discount from face value, and generally carries lower interest repayment rates than bonds due to the shorter maturities of commercial paper. Typically, the longer the maturity on a note, the higher the interest rate the issuing institution pays. Interest rates fluctuate with market conditions, but are typically lower than banks' rates.
Commercial paper ‚Äì though a short-term obligation ‚Äì is issued as part of a continuous rolling program, which is either a number of years long (as in Europe), or open-ended (as in the U.S.)

ICLR (International Conference on Learning Representations) is a premier machine learning conference. Unlike the other two flagship machine learning conferences ICML and NIPS, ICLR chooses a single-blind public review process in which the reviews and their rebuttals are both carried out transparently and in the open. This dataset was created by crawling the public ICLR 2017 paper review site. It seems ICLR is going double-blind from 2018, so my guess is that authors will remain anonymous during the review process. So, this dataset is unique because it captures a public academic review process with academic affiliations and all paper decisions including rejections.
Content
The dataset consists of two CSV files:
iclr2017_papers.csv: This file has a row per submission. It includes the paper title, authors, author conflicts, abstracts, tl;dr (a simplified abstract), and final decision (Accept/Oral, Accept/Poster, Accept/InviteToWorkshop, Reject). Each row has a unique identifier key called the ""paper_id.""
iclr2017_conversations.csv: This file has a row per textual review, rebuttal, or comment. It is related to the previous papers dataset using the secondary key ""paper_id."" All rows talking about a single paper share the same ""paper_id."" The conversations associated with each paper can be thought of as a forest. Each tree in the forest begins with a review followed by rebuttals and further comments/conversation. Each such textual entry composed by an individual is listed in its own row. The nodes of the tree are connected using the fields ""child_id"" and ""parent_id"" which can be used to construct the entire conversation hierarchy.

In commercial agriculture it is common practice to retain so-called crop residue (agricultural product left on the field after a harvest) on planting fields. This is a commonly recommended practice in conservation agriculture.
This dataset is a measurement of the adoption and impact of the methodology for a selection of agricultural fields. Six different crop residue coverage measurement methods are included: i) interviewee (respondent) estimation; ii) enumerator estimation visiting the field; iii) interviewee with visual-aid without visiting the field; iv) enumerator with visual-aid visiting the field; v) field picture collected with a drone and analyzed with image-processing methods and vi) satellite picture of the field analyzed with remote sensing methods.

Natural Stories Corpus,A corpus of stories with human reading times (by word),Rachael Tatman,4,"Version 1,2017-08-29","reading
languages
literature
linguistics",CSV,31 MB,CC4,803 views,67 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/natural-stories-corpus,"Context:
It is now a common practice to compare models of human language processing by predicting participant reactions (such as reading times) to corpora consisting of rich naturalistic linguistic materials. However, many of the corpora used in these studies are based on naturalistic text and thus do not contain many of the low-frequency syntactic constructions that are often required to distinguish processing theories. The corpus includes self-paced reading time data for ten naturalistic stories.
Content:
This is a corpus of naturalistic stories meant to contain varied, low-frequency syntactic constructions. There are a variety of annotations and psycholinguistic measures available for the stories. The stories in with their various annotations are coordinated around the file words.tsv, which specifies a unique code for each token in the story under a variety of different tokenization schemes. For example, the following lines in words.tsv cover the phrase the long-bearded mill owners.:
1.54.whole the
1.54.word the
1.54.1 the
1.55.whole long - bearded
1.55.word long - bearded
1.55.1 long
1.55.2 -
1.55.3 bearded
1.56.whole mill
1.56.word mill
1.56.1 mill
1.57.whole owners .
1.57.word owners
1.57.1 owners
1.57.2 .
The first column is the token code; the second is the token itself. For example, 1.57.whole represents the token owners.and 1.57.word represents the token owners. The token code consists of three fields:
The id of the story the token is found in,
The number of the token in the story,
An additional field whose value is whole for the entire token including punctuation, word for the token stripped of punctuation to the left and right, and then 1 through n for each sub-token in whole as segmented by NLTK's TreebankWordTokenizer.
The various annotations (frequencies, parses, RTs, etc.) should reference these codes so that we can track tokens uniformly.
This dataset contains reading time data collected for 10 naturalistic stories. Participants typically read 5 stories each. The data is contained in batch1_pro.csv and batch2_pro.csv
all_stories.tok contains the 10 stories, with one word per row. Item is the story number, zone is the region where the word falls within the story. Note that some wordforms in all_stories.tok differ from those in words.tsv, reflecting typos in the SPR experiment as run.

Although there have been lot of studies undertaken in the past on factors affecting life expectancy considering demographic variables, income composition and mortality rates. It was found that affect of immunization and human development index was not taken into account in the past. Also, some of the past research was done considering multiple linear regression based on data set of one year for all the countries. Hence, this gives motivation to resolve both the factors stated previously by formulating a regression model based on mixed effects model and multiple linear regression while considering data from a period of 2000 to 2015 for all the countries. Important immunization like Hepatitis B, Polio and Diphtheria will also be considered. In a nutshell, this study will focus on immunization factors, mortality factors, economic factors, social factors and other health related factors as well. Since the observations this dataset are based on different countries, it will be easier for a country to determine the predicting factor which is contributing to lower value of life expectancy. This will help in suggesting a country which area should be given importance in order to efficiently improve the life expectancy of its population.
Content
The project relies on accuracy of data. The Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under World Health Organization (WHO) keeps track of the health status as well as many other related factors for all countries The data-sets are made available to public for the purpose of health data analysis. The data-set related to life expectancy, health factors for 193 countries has been collected from the same WHO data repository website and its corresponding economic data was collected from United Nation website. Among all categories of health-related factors only those critical factors were chosen which are more representative. It has been observed that in the past 15 years , there has been a huge development in health sector resulting in improvement of human mortality rates especially in the developing nations in comparison to the past 30 years. Therefore, in this project we have considered data from year 2000-2015 for 193 countries for further analysis. The individual data files have been merged together into a single data-set. On initial visual inspection of the data showed some missing values. As the data-sets were from WHO, we found no evident errors. Missing data was handled in R software by using Missmap command. The result indicated that most of the missing data was for population, Hepatitis B and GDP. The missing data were from less known countries like Vanuatu, Tonga, Togo, Cabo Verde etc. Finding all data for these countries was difficult and hence, it was decided that we exclude these countries from the final model data-set. The final merged file(final dataset) consists of 22 Columns and 2938 rows which meant 20 predicting variables. All predicting variables was then divided into several broad categories:Immunization related factors, Mortality factors, Economical factors and Social factors.
Acknowledgements
The data was collected from WHO and United Nations website with the help of Deeksha Russell and Duan Wang.
Inspiration
The data-set aims to answer the following key questions: 1. Does various predicting factors which has been chosen initially really affect the Life expectancy? What are the predicting variables actually affecting the life expectancy? 2. Should a country having a lower life expectancy value(<65) increase its healthcare expenditure in order to improve its average lifespan? 3. How does Infant and Adult mortality rates affect life expectancy? 4. Does Life Expectancy has positive or negative correlation with eating habits, lifestyle, exercise, smoking, drinking alcohol etc. 5. What is the impact of schooling on the lifespan of humans? 6. Does Life Expectancy have positive or negative relationship with drinking alcohol? 7. Do densely populated countries tend to have lower life expectancy? 8. What is the impact of Immunization coverage on life Expectancy?"

The system in focus is the Air Pressure system (APS) which generates pressurized air that is utilized in various functions in a truck, such as braking and gear changes. The datasets' positive class consists of component failures for a specific component of the APS system. The negative class consists of trucks with failures for components not related to the APS. The data consists of a subset of all available data, selected by experts.
Content
The training set contains 60000 examples in total in which 59000 belong to the negative class and 1000 positive class. The test set contains 16000 examples. There are 171 attributes per record.
The attribute names of the data have been anonymized for proprietary reasons. It consists of both single numerical counters and histograms consisting of bins with different conditions. Typically the histograms have open-ended conditions at each end. For example, if we measuring the ambient temperature ""T"" then the histogram could be defined with 4 bins where:

The total cost of a prediction model the sum of Cost_1 multiplied by the number of Instances with type 1 failure and Cost_2 with the number of instances with type 2 failure, resulting in a Total_cost. In this case Cost_1 refers to the cost that an unnecessary check needs to be done by an mechanic at an workshop, while Cost_2 refer to the cost of missing a faulty truck, which may cause a breakdown. Cost_1 = 10 and Cost_2 = 500, and Total_cost = Cost_1*No_Instances + Cost_2*No_Instances.

The Fantasy Premier League has become more popular every year. In the FPL, people pick fantasy teams of real-life players, and every week, receive points based on their picks' real-life performance.
Within this dataset, we have some historical data for the player performance in previous seasons, as well as future match fixtures.
Content
The three main components currently in this dataset are:
The individual players' current performance stats.
The individual players' past performance stats (how much historical data depends on the player).
A list of future match fixtures.
All the data was taken from the Official Fantasy Premier League website.
N.B. A lot of the data was cobbled together from the output of publicly accessible JSON endpoints, therefore there are a lot of duplications (as fixture data was initially from the perspective of the individual players). Also, since a lot of this data is used to drive the UI of a Web Application, there are a lot of redundancies, all of which could do with being cleaned up.
Inspiration
A lot of my friends are massively into all aspects of the Premier League (fantasy or otherwise), so my main motivation in putting this dataset together was to see was it possible to gain a competitive advantage over my very domain knowledgeable friends, with little to no domain knowledge myself.
The obvious questions that could be answered with this data correspond to predicting the future performance of players based on historical metrics."

Intermediate point data (Taxi trip duration),First 2000 rows with intermediate point data using Google Maps API,Soumitra Agarwal,4,"Version 1,2017-07-30",,CSV,2 MB,ODbL,879 views,43 downloads,,,https://www.kaggle.com/artimous/intermediate-point-data-taxi-trip-duration,"Context
Realising which routes a taxi takes while going from one location to another gives us deep insights into why some trips take longer than others. Also, most taxis rely on navigation from Google Maps, which reinforces the use case of this dataset. On a deeper look, we can begin to analyse patches of slow traffic and number of steps during the trip (explained below).
Content
The data, as we see it contains the following columns :
trip_id, pickup_latitude, pickup_longitude (and equivalents with dropoff) are picked up from the original dataset.
distance : Estimates the distance between the start and the end latitude, in miles.
start_address and end_address are directly picked up from the Google Maps API
params : Details set of parameters, flattened out into a single line. (Explained below)
Parameters
The parameters field is a long string of a flattened out JSON object. At its very basic, the field has space separated steps. The syntax is as follows :
Step1:{ ... }, Step2:{ ...
Each step denotes the presence of an intermediate point.
Inside the curly braces of each of the steps we have the distance for that step measured in ft, and the start and end location. The start and end location are surrounded by round braces and are in the following format :
Step1:{distance=X ft/mi start_location=(latitude, longitude) end_location ...}, ...
One can split the internal params over space to get all the required values.
Acknowledgements
All the credit for the data goes to the Google Maps API, though limited to 2000 queries per day. I believe that even that limited amount would help us gain great insights.
Future prospects
More data : Since the number of rows processed are just 2000, with a good response we might be able to get more. If you feel like contributing, please have a look at the script here and try and run in for the next 2000 rows.
Driver instructions : I did not include the driver instruction column in the data from the google API as it seemed to complex to use in any kind of models. If that is not the general opinion, I can add it here."

Bike Sharing Dataset
Hadi Fanaee-T
Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Decision Support (LIAAD), University of Porto INESC Porto, Campus da FEUP Rua Dr. Roberto Frias, 378 4200 - 465 Porto, Portugal
=========================================
Background
Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues.
Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.
=========================================
Data Set
Bike-sharing rental process is highly correlated to the environmental and seasonal settings. For instance, weather conditions, precipitation, day of week, season, hour of the day, etc. can affect the rental behaviors. The core data set is related to
the two-year historical log corresponding to years 2011 and 2012 from Capital Bikeshare system, Washington D.C., USA which is publicly available in http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data. We aggregated the data on two hourly and daily basis and then extracted and added the corresponding weather and seasonal information. Weather information are extracted from http://www.freemeteo.com.
=========================================
Associated tasks
- Regression: 
    Predication of bike rental count hourly or daily based on the environmental and seasonal settings.

- Event and Anomaly Detection:  
    Count of rented bikes are also correlated to some events in the town which easily are traceable via search engines.
    For instance, query like ""2012-10-30 washington d.c."" in Google returns related results to Hurricane Sandy. Some of the important events are 
    identified in [1]. Therefore the data can be used for validation of anomaly or event detection algorithms as well.

The goal of this Corporate Prosecutions Registry is to provide comprehensive and up-to-date information on federal organizational prosecutions in the United States, so that we can better understand how corporate prosecutions are brought and resolved. It includes detailed information about every federal organizational prosecution since 2001, as well as deferred and non-prosecution agreements with organizations since 1990.
Dataset Description
These data on deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were collected by identifying agreements through news searches, press releases by the Department of Justice and U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office, and also when practitioners brought agreements to our attention. The Government Accountability Office conducted a study of federal deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements with organizations, and in August 2010, the GAO provided a list of those agreements in response to an information request. Finally, searches of the Bloomberg dockets database located additional prosecution agreements with companies that had not previously been located. Jon Ashley has contacted U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Offices to request agreements. An effort by the First Amendment Clinic at the University of Virginia School of Law to litigate Freedom of Information Act requests resulted in locating a group of missing agreements which are now available on the Registry.
This Registry only includes information about federal organizational prosecutions, and not cases brought solely in state courts. Nor does this Registry include leniency agreements entered through the Antitrust Division‚Äôs leniency program, which are kept confidential. The Registry also does not include convictions overturned on appeal, or cases in which the indictment was dismissed or the company was acquitted at a trial.
The U.S. Sentencing Commission reports sentencing data concerning organizational prosecutions each year. That data does not include cases resolved without a formal sentencing, such as deferred and non-prosecution agreements.

Which industries face the most prosecutions?
Which government organizations have been the most successful at pursuing cases against corporations?
Not a single case in the dataset led to a trial conviction. Can you link these corporate cases to criminal cases against the individuals involved? How many of them were convicted instead?"

What you get:**
+25,000 matches

11 European Countries with their lead championship
Seasons 2008 to 2016
Players and Teams' attributes* sourced from EA Sports' FIFA video game series, including the weekly updates - - Team line up with squad formation (X, Y coordinates)
Betting odds from up to 10 providers
Detailed match events (goal types, possession, corner, cross, fouls, cards etc...) for +10,000 matches
*16th Oct 2016: New table containing teams' attributes from FIFA !
Original Data Source:
You can easily find data about soccer matches but they are usually scattered across different websites. A thorough data collection and processing has been done to make your life easier. I must insist that you do not make any commercial use of the data. The data was sourced from:
http://football-data.mx-api.enetscores.com/ : scores, lineup, team formation and events
http://www.football-data.co.uk/ : betting odds. Click here to understand the column naming system for betting odds:
http://sofifa.com/ : players and teams attributes from EA Sports FIFA games. FIFA series and all FIFA assets property of EA Sports.
When you have a look at the database, you will notice foreign keys for players and matches are the same as the original data sources. I have called those foreign keys ""api_id"".
Improving the dataset:
You will notice that some players are missing from the lineup (NULL values). This is because I have not been able to source their attributes from FIFA. This will be fixed overtime as the crawling algorithm is being improved. The dataset will also be expanded to include international games, national cups, Champion's League and Europa League. Please ask me if you're after a specific tournament.
Please get in touch with Hugo Mathien if you want to help improve this dataset.
CLICK HERE TO ACCESS THE PROJECT GITHUB
Important note for people interested in using the crawlers: since I first wrote the crawling scripts (in python), it appears sofifa.com has changed its design and with it comes new requirements for the scripts. The existing script to crawl players ('Player Spider') will not work until i've updated it.
Exploring the data:
Now that's the fun part, there is a lot you can do with this dataset. I will be adding visuals and insights to this overview page but please have a look at the kernels and give it a try yourself ! Here are some ideas for you:
The Holy Grail... ... is obviously to predict the outcome of the game. The bookies use 3 classes (Home Win, Draw, Away Win). They get it right about 53% of the time. This is also what I've achieved so far using my own SVM. Though it may sound high for such a random sport game, you've got to know that the home team wins about 46% of the time. So the base case (constantly predicting Home Win) has indeed 46% precision.
Probabilities vs Odds
When running a multi-class classifier like SVM you could also output a probability estimate and compare it to the betting odds. Have a look at your variance vs odds and see for what games you had very different predictions.
Explore and visualize features
With access to players and teams attributes, team formations and in-game events you should be able to produce some interesting insights into The Beautiful Game .

Title: Wine Quality
Sources Created by: Paulo Cortez (Univ. Minho), Antonio Cerdeira, Fernando Almeida, Telmo Matos and Jose Reis (CVRVV) @ 2009
Past Usage:

In the above reference, two datasets were created, using red and white wine samples. The inputs include objective tests (e.g. PH values) and the output is based on sensory data (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). Several data mining methods were applied to model these datasets under a regression approach. The support vector machine model achieved the best results. Several metrics were computed: MAD, confusion matrix for a fixed error tolerance (T), etc. Also, we plot the relative importances of the input variables (as measured by a sensitivity analysis procedure).
Relevant Information:
The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese ""Vinho Verde"" wine. For more details, consult: http://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/ or the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).
These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are munch more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods.
Number of Instances: red wine - 1599; white wine - 4898.
Number of Attributes: 11 + output attribute
Note: several of the attributes may be correlated, thus it makes sense to apply some sort of feature selection.
Attribute information:
For more information, read [Cortez et al., 2009].
Input variables (based on physicochemical tests): 1 - fixed acidity (tartaric acid - g / dm^3) 2 - volatile acidity (acetic acid - g / dm^3) 3 - citric acid (g / dm^3) 4 - residual sugar (g / dm^3) 5 - chlorides (sodium chloride - g / dm^3 6 - free sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3) 7 - total sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3) 8 - density (g / cm^3) 9 - pH 10 - sulphates (potassium sulphate - g / dm3) 11 - alcohol (% by volume) Output variable (based on sensory data): 12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
Missing Attribute Values: None
Description of attributes:
1 - fixed acidity: most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily)
2 - volatile acidity: the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste
3 - citric acid: found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines
4 - residual sugar: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet
5 - chlorides: the amount of salt in the wine
6 - free sulfur dioxide: the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine
7 - total sulfur dioxide: amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine
8 - density: the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content
9 - pH: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale
10 - sulphates: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant
11 - alcohol: the percent alcohol content of the wine
Output variable (based on sensory data): 12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)"

I am the Director of a technical recruiting team and I would love to get a better look at their peaks, valleys, hurdles, and hot spots to see how i can better manager and show them the value in process improvements. The data is dirty at best they didnt always track or enter in the correct pieces. I have been here for 6 months and it has been a steady improvement. I welcome any recommendations or data you can suggest.
You will see our client numbers from open projects, to the activity and team production

I am attaching what i call the MBO form ""Management by Objective"". The form is completed weekly by my team to help track how they are doing from an activity perspective. Its a name i'm living with not loving just yet. This data is a year long look into how many people they screened how many people they submitted to projects and how many people they put on projects. The other issue is some of the data changed when i joined the team so please look at in in 2 pieces. Jan - June 2016 July - Dec 2016... I just started in June and added more granularity. There has also been some turn over so you will see partial data from some of my team

Interactive Fiction Competition Entrants,Ranking and background data for IFComp games,Brian Rushton,4,"Version 4,2017-04-18|Version 3,2017-04-15|Version 2,2017-02-03|Version 1,2017-02-03","literature

The Interactive Fiction Competition is the internet's oldest game programming competition, starting in 1995 and continuing to this day. Interactive Fiction is an unusual genre because it has been centralized in the Interactive Fiction Database for the last decade, and essentially all games of interest are recorded there. It is also a niche genre, and the amount of public interest has varied much less than other genres since 1995.
Content
This database contains the placement (i.e. 1st place, 2nd place, etc.) of all games ever entered into the IFComp, together with their genre, number of ifdb ratings and average ifdb rating. It also contains the system; a few programming languages have tended to dominate the competition. It also contains the forgiveness rating, which indicates how difficult the game can be expected to be. Much of the information is null.
Note that the IFDB was created in 2006, 11 years after the competition began.
Inspiration
IFDB ratings represent lasting interest, as these have been gathered over many years, while IFComp rankings represent a short, 6-week period.
It would be interesting to see the relationship between the two, how that relationship has changed over time, etc.
Also, Inform and TADS have always dominated the competition, but it's recently been changing. The change in systems over the years should be interesting.
Finally, it would be interesting to see time-adjusted averages of reviews for comp games over time, to see if new games are receiving less interest than old games.

""Each record represents follow-up data for one breast cancer case. These are consecutive patients seen by Dr. Wolberg since 1984, and include only those cases exhibiting invasive breast cancer and no evidence of distant metastases at the time of diagnosis.
The first 30 features are computed from a digitized image of a
fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.  They describe
characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
A few of the images can be found at

The separation described above was obtained using
Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T) [K. P. Bennett, ""Decision Tree
Construction Via Linear Programming."" Proceedings of the 4th
Midwest Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Society,
pp. 97-101, 1992], a classification method which uses linear
programming to construct a decision tree.  Relevant features
were selected using an exhaustive search in the space of 1-4
features and 1-3 separating planes.

The actual linear program used to obtain the separating plane
in the 3-dimensional space is that described in:
[K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: ""Robust Linear
Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets"",
Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].

The Recurrence Surface Approximation (RSA) method is a linear

history
international relations",CSV,3 MB,Other,"1,562 views",114 downloads,3 kernels,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/sdorius/gssi2017,"BACKGROUND:
The survey stands out as one of the most significant methodological innovations in the history of the social sciences. The instrument has made possible the efficient and reliable collection of measurements on individual attitudes, beliefs, values, behaviors, traits, and states (Alwin 2009), and coupled with modern sampling techniques, surveys have allowed researchers to generalize findings to much larger populations with remarkable precision. Survey data have helped governments to obtain essential descriptive information on, for example, their citizen‚Äôs living standards, demographic attributes, health status, purchasing intentions. Such data have, in turn, been used to craft evidence-based social and economic policies, more accurately forecast labor market participation and project population distributions, and monitor poverty rates. Commercial firms, especially those in the fields of market research and consumer behavior, have also been influential in the development of methods and the production of designed data (Groves 2011). Social scientists use survey data to study a wide range of social, economic, political, demographic, and cultural topics and to collect measurements of voter preferences, personality traits, social networks, and public opinions, to name a few. Survey data are an essential component of evidence-based social policy-making and program monitoring and evaluation and vital tool for understanding the worldviews and aspirations of publics around the world.
The progression of the social survey from its origins as a community and, later, national measuring device was attended by greater consensus and less variation in survey design and administration. Over the course of more than 60 years of cross-cultural survey research, the standardized survey (Gobo and Mauceri 2014; Harkness 2010) became the de facto one, with hallmark features including an almost exclusive reliance on input harmonized questionnaires and closed-ended questions, English language parent survey back translated into local-language-administered surveys, and best efforts at nationally representative sampling techniques that allow for generalization to, in most cases, the non-institutionalized adult population. With few exceptions, survivor programs originated in rich, western countries, and among survey programs originating in non-western countries, survey design and content has often been patterned after surveys designed to measure attitudes, beliefs, behaviors, states, and institutions endemic to western, industrialized societies. This is not to say that cross-national survey programs are monolithic or lacking in variety of design, content, international membership, and purposes.
THE DATA:
To get a clearer understanding of how the social survey has spread around the world over the last 60 years, we collected information from just under 40 international survey programs and compiled it into a time-series data set that allows researchers to empirically evaluate the global social survey data infrastructure from a life-history perspective. Collectively, these 40 survey programs have fielded over 7000 national social surveys comprising nearly 8 million completed interviews on a broad range of social, economic, and political topics. Units of analysis in the data set are survey programs and national social surveys. Additional data about programs and surveys include samples sizes, data collection methods, fielding dates, and countries surveyed, to name a few.

I was looking for a campsite for a group of friends in between Salt Lake City and Grand Teton NP, and was struggling to find a tent-only campsite along the highway corridors leading to Grand Teton NP. In the past I had always felt that finding tent only campsites in California was quite easy compared to other places I‚Äôve camped in the American West. I tidied this data set from RIDB to determine whether or not my ease in booking tent-only campsites in CA was due to a larger number of those sites, or if the state of CA had a relative enrichment for tent-only campsites."

This dataset contains territorial claims across the entire interstate system between 1816-2001 and includes information on participants, dates, the significance of the claimed territories, and militarization of these claims. A territorial claim is defined as explicit contention between two or more nation-states claiming sovereignty over a specific piece of territory. Official government representatives (i.e., individuals who are authorized to make or state foreign policy positions for their governments) must make explicit statements claiming sovereignty over the same territory.
Our goal is to identify cases where nation-states have disagreed over specific issues in the modern era, as well as measuring what made those issues valuable to them and studying how they chose to manage or settle those issues. The Issue Correlates of War (ICOW) project does not endorse official positions on any territorial claim. Inclusion/exclusion of specific cases, and coding of details related to those cases, follows strict guidelines presented in the project's coding manuals.

Composed mostly of water ice with embedded dust particles, comets originally formed in the cold outer planetary system while most of the rocky asteroids formed in the warmer inner solar system between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The scientific interest in comets and asteroids is due largely to their status as the relatively unchanged remnant debris from the solar system formation process some 4.6 billion years ago. The giant outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed from an agglomeration of billions of comets and the left over bits and pieces from this formation process are the comets we see today. Likewise, today's asteroids are the bits and pieces left over from the initial agglomeration of the inner planets that include Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.
As the primitive, leftover building blocks of the solar system formation process, comets and asteroids offer clues to the chemical mixture from which the planets formed some 4.6 billion years ago. If we wish to know the composition of the primordial mixture from which the planets formed, then we must determine the chemical constituents of the leftover debris from this formation process - the comets and asteroids."

However, the low positive predictive value of breast biopsy resulting from mammogram interpretation leads to approximately 70% unnecessary biopsies with benign outcomes. To reduce the high number of unnecessary breast biopsies, several computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been proposed in the last years.These systems help physicians in their decision to perform a breast biopsy on a suspicious lesion seen in a mammogram or to perform a short term follow-up examination instead. This data set can be used to predict the severity (benign or malignant) of a mammographic mass lesion from BI-RADS attributes and the patient's age. It contains a BI-RADS assessment, the patient's age and three BI-RADS attributes together with the ground truth (the severity field) for 516 benign and 445 malignant masses that have been identified on full field digital mammograms collected at the Institute of Radiology of the University Erlangen-Nuremberg between 2003 and 2006. Each instance has an associated BI-RADS assessment ranging from 1 (definitely benign) to 5 (highly suggestive of malignancy) assigned in a double-review process by physicians. Assuming that all cases with BI-RADS assessments greater or equal a given value (varying from 1 to 5), are malignant and the other cases benign, sensitivities and associated specificities can be calculated. These can be an indication of how well a CAD system performs compared to the radiologists.

Predicting Movie Revenue,"depends on multiple factors like cast, budget, review, rating, release year",sumanth,4,"Version 1,2016-10-06",,Other,99 KB,ODbL,"3,048 views",588 downloads,3 kernels,,https://www.kaggle.com/sumanthpola/predicting-movie-revenue,"Movie revenue depends on multiple factors such as cast, budget, film critic review, MPAA rating, release year, etc. Because of these multiple factors there is no analytical formula for predicting how much revenue a movie will generate. However by analyzing revenues generated by previous movies, one can build a model which can help us predict the expected revenue for a movie. Such a prediction could be very useful for the movie studio which will be producing the movie so they can decide on expenses like artist compensations, advertising, promotions, etc. accordingly. Plus investors can predict an expected return-on-investment."

In this case I give some ideas to Kaggle users and show my results.
Past Research
I start from these questions:
1. What kind of horses win more money then lose?
I found 6 mask: I load data for 8 years and create pivot table with race results and type of races by distance and horses options. After that I calculate sum of PPMIN and PPMAX for this horse. And finally, I calculate dispersion to filter more stable masks.
2. How many selected horses run daily/monthly? Is something change when the season changes?
3. What kind of bets do I need to use and how much money do I need to start? When should I start?

The government of Shanghai has adopted an auction system to limit the number of license plates issued for every month. The dataset contains historical data of auctions from Jan 2002 to Oct 2017.
how the auction system works: A starting price is given at the beginning of the auction, bidders can only bid up to 3 times for each auction and can only mark up or down within 300 CNY ( roughly 46 USD ) for each bid. At the end of each auction, only the top n ( number of plates that will be issued for the month ) bids will get the license plates at the cost of their bids. The nth bid will be the lowest deal price for the month. Please note that the auctions are conducted online and each bidder will not be able to see other bids.
Columns:
Date: Jan 2002 to Oct 2017 ( note that Feb 2008 is missing)
*num_bidder*: number of citizens who participate the auction for the month
*num_plates*: number of plates that will be issued by the government for the month
*lowest_deal_price*: explained above, in CNY
*avg_deal_price*: average deal price, in CNY ( note that since each bid can only be marked up or down within 300, it is not drifting too far away from the lowest deal price)
The goal is to predict the lowest_deal_price for each month, the actual result will be updated at the end of every month

This dataset was created during my PhD (http://www.tdg-seville.info/fogallego/Personal%20Info) at the University of Seville. We didn't found any datasets with labelled conditions so we decided to build one since our main goal for the PhD was to be able to identify conditions without relying on user-defined patterns or requiring any specific-purpose dictionaries, taxonomies, or heuristics.
Content
The reviews in English and Spanish were randomly gathered from ciao.com between April 2017 and May 2017. The sentences were classified into 15 domains according to their sources, namely: adults, baby care, beauty, books, cameras, computers, films, headsets, hotels, music, ovens, pets, phones, TV sets, and video games.
Our dataset consist of two files: sentences.csv and conditions.csv. The first one contains the whole set of sentences and the second one the manually labelled conditions.
In order to better understand the meaning of each column, I'll explain them in detail:
sentence.csv:
sentence_uuid: the unique identifier of the sentence
sentence_text: the text of the sentence
language: the language of the sentence
domain: the domain of the sentence
labelled: whether the sentence was labelled or not
conditions.csv:
sentence_uuid: the unique identifier of the corresponding labelled sentence
condition_uuid: the unique identifier of the condition
begin_connective: the character position where the connective of the condition starts
end_connective: the character position where the connective of the condition ends
begin_condition: the character position where the rest of the condition starts
end_condition: the character position where the rest of the condition ends
language: the language of the corresponding labelled sentence
domain: the domain of the corresponding labelled sentence

Urdu is an indo-Aryan language with over 100 million speakers. It is mainly used in Pakistan. While often mutually intelligible with Hindi, the two languages use different scripts and as a result NLP tools developed for Hindi are often not extendible to Urdu.
Some words, like ‚Äúthe‚Äù or ‚Äúand‚Äù in English, are used a lot in speech and writing. For most Natural Language Processing applications, you will want to remove these very frequent words. This is usually done using a list of ‚Äústopwords‚Äù which has been complied by hand.

How do you design a computer vision algorithm that is able to detect and segment people when they are captured by a visible light camera, thermal camera, and a depth sensor? And how do you fuse the three inherently different data streams such that you can reliably transfer features from one modality to another? Feel free to download our dataset and try it out yourselves!
Content
The dataset features a total of 5724 annotated frames divided in three indoor scenes. Activity in scene 1 and 3 is using the full depth range of the Kinect for XBOX 360 sensor whereas activity in scene 2 is constrained to a depth range of plus/minus 0.250 m in order to suppress the parallax between the two physical sensors. Scene 1 and 2 are situated in a closed meeting room with little natural light to disturb the depth sensing, whereas scene 3 is situated in an area with wide windows and a substantial amount of sunlight. For each scene, a total of three persons are interacting, reading, walking, sitting, reading, etc.
Every person is annotated with a unique ID in the scene on a pixel-level in the RGB modality. For the thermal and depth modalities, annotations are transferred from the RGB images using a registration algorithm found in registrator.cpp.
We have used our AAU VAP Multimodal Pixel Annotator to create the ground-truth, pixel-based masks for all three modalities.

Swedish NER corpus,"~8000 sentences annotated for Swedish NER (PER, LOC, ORG, MISC)",Andreas Klintberg,4,"Version 1,2017-12-13",languages,Other,1 MB,CC4,372 views,13 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/andreasklintberg/swedish-ner-corpus,"Context
Bootstrapped and manually annotated NER Swedish web news from 2012. NER stands for Named entity recognition, and its used to describe entities in a text such as organisations, locations and people for instance.
Its a very common operation in general NLP pipeline, and several algorithms can be used to train a model. Traditionally many NER systems were trained using some kind of CRF (conditionally random fields) approach, but nowadays many people successfully uses LSTM:s or other sequence based deep learning techniques.
A tutorial on how to use this dataset to train an NER for Stanford CoreNLP is available here https://medium.com/@klintcho/training-a-swedish-ner-model-for-stanford-corenlp-part-2-20a0cfd801dd
Content
The dataset is very simple and can easily be adapted into other formats, it is specifically adapted to CoreNLP NER. Thus the first column is a word. Second column (tab separated) is either the NER category (ORG, PER, LOC, MISC) or a 0 if it does not belong to any category (not an entity). Each word is separated by a new line, and each sentence is separated by an empty new line.
Sample structure (of two sentences, one three word sentence, and another 4 word sentence): Apple ORG is 0 nice 0 . 0
Per PER is 0 not 0 sad 0

Malicious websites are of great concern. Unfortunately there is a lack of datasets that classify malicious vs benign web characteristics. This dataset is a research production of my bachelor students that aims to fill this gap.
Content
The project sought to evaluate classification models to predict malicious and benign websites, based on application layer and network characteristics. The data were obtained by using different verified sources of benign and malicious URL, in a low interactive client honeypot to isolate network traffic. We used additional tools to get other information, such as server country with Whois.
This is the first version and we have some initial results from applying machine learning classifiers in a bachelor thesis. Further details on the data process making and the data description can be found in the article below.

In working on Unicode implementations, it is often useful to access the full content of the Unicode Character Database (UCD). For example, in establishing mappings from characters to glyphs in fonts, it is convenient to see the character scalar value, the character name, the character East Asian width, along with the shape and metrics of the proposed glyph to map to; looking at all this data simultaneously helps in evaluating the mapping.
This is a machine-readable version of the Unicode Character Database in JSON format.
Content:
The majority of information about individual codepoints is represented using properties. Each property, except for the Special_Case_Condition and Name_Alias properties, is represented by an attribute. In an XML data file, the absence of an attribute (may be only on some code-points) means that the document does not express the value of the corresponding property. Conversely, the presence of an attribute is an expression of the corresponding property value; the implied null value is represented by the empty string.
The Name_Alias property is represented by zero or more name-alias child elements. Unlike the situation for properties represented by attributes, it is not possible to determine whether all of the aliases have been represented in a data file by inspecting that data file.
The name of an attribute is the abbreviated name of the property as given in the file PropertyAliases.txt in version 6.1.0 of the UCD. For the Unihan properties, the name is that given in the various versions of the Unihan database (some properties are no longer present in version 6.1.0).
For catalog and enumerated properties, the values are those listed in the file PropertyValueAliases.txt in version 6.1.0 of the UCD; if there is an abbreviated name, it is used, otherwise the long name is used. Note that the set of possible values for a property captured in this schema may change from one version to the next.
The following properties are associated with code points:
Age property
Name properties
Name Aliases
Block
General Category
Combining properties
Bidirectionality properties
Decomposition properties
Numeric Properties
Joining properties
Linebreak properties
East Asian Width property
Case properties
Script properties
ISO Comment properties
Hangul properties
Indic properties
Identifier and Pattern and programming language properties
Properties related to function and graphic characteristics
Properties related to boundaries
Properties related to ideographs

The act of ending one‚Äôs own life stating the reasons to be depression, alcoholism or any other mental disorders for that matter is not a considerable idea keeping in mind that anything can be overcome with reliable help and lifestyle. We can choose to stand together in the face of a society which may often feel like a lonely and disconnected place, and we can choose to make a difference by making lives more livable for those who struggle to cope. Through this project, I am hoping to identify the trends of suicidal rates by country, gender, age and ethnicity. And relate the trends to the possible reasons that leads to the drastic decision, which might help us to curb the thought in the very beginning.
What's inside is more than just rows and columns. Make it easy for others to get started by describing how you acquired the data and what time period it represents, too. Data on suicides is deficient for two reasons, first of all, there is a problem with the frequency and reliability of vital registration data in many countries ‚Äì an issue that undermine the quality of mortality estimates in general, not just suicide. Secondly, there are problems with the accuracy of the official figures made available, since suicide registration is a complicated process involving several responsible authorities with medical and legal concerns. Moreover, the illegality of suicidal behavior in some countries contributes to under reporting and misclassification. I was lucky enough to obtain enough data from different reliable resources. I will be starting off the project with the most reliable datasets available for us on suicide.
‚Ä¢World Health Organization (WHO) dataset which contains entity wise suicide rates, crude suicide rates per gender and country which are age standardized which has a geographical coverage of 198 countries. The time spanning from 1950-2011.
‚Ä¢Samaritans statistics report 2017 including data for 2013-2015, in order to reduce the time, it takes to register deaths, the maximum time between a death and registration is eight days.
‚Ä¢American Association of Suicidology facts and statistics which are categorized by age, gender, region and ethnicity.
Inspiration: To visualize the trends and patterns by merging different datasets available regarding the subject matter from different organizations, deriving the major causes for the drastic stride. And also observing the changes in patterns over the years by country, sex and ethnicity
Understanding the data: It is always tricky to understand the suicide statistics as they may not be so straight forward as they appear to be. Generally, the rate is per 100,000. It is done this way to adjust the underlying population size. ‚ÄòAge-standardized‚Äô rates have been standardized to the world population to increase the confidence while making the comparisons. On the other hand, ‚ÄòCrude rates‚Äô have not been standardized like the prior, so they are just the basic calculation of number of deaths divided by the population (x100,000). The size of the population and specific cohort is also to be taken into account as smaller groups often produce less reliable rates per 100,000. When examining the suicide trends over a period of time it is also important to look over a relatively long period. Increases and decreases for a year at a time should not be considered in isolation."

I want my computer to react to simple, short, predefined commands. I do not need it to understand any meaning or do complex things, just to recognize and react. I created this dataset to explore possible audio classification algorithms that can ultimately be transferred to the real world.

I have selected single-syllable English verbs, obtained their pronounciations (phonemes) via to the British English Example Pronciation dictionary, and let espeak pronounce it varying the pronounciations, stress, pitch, speed and speaker.
You can play individual words samples with any audio player that understands ogg (e.g. VLC). The samples still sound a bit mechanic, but it is a start.
For simplicity, consider the dog sub-sample, which only contains four commands: ""chase"" ""fetch"" ""sit"" ""walk"". They are fairly easy for the ear to distinguish, even in poor quality audio.
To create the classification data set (db.dog.hdf5), I added AURORA noise with varying volume and convertedd the audio data to 24x24 frequency-vs-time ""images"" (spectrograms). The file comes with class labels (word ID).

Machine learning audio training data is lacking, and this aims to solve that."

Indian Hindi Cinema, popularly known as Bollywood has witnessed exponential growth in terms of volume of business, manpower employed, number of movies produced each year and also the global reach. Hence, it could be of great commercial importance to develop a model which could predict the success of a movie before it's release. However, it is not easy to forecast demand for a movie. There are a number of factors like Actors, Directors, Time of Release, Genre, Production house etc. which affect the outcome of a movie.
The primary requirement to develop such a model would be the availability of Bollywood movie data. Thus, I created this dataset while working on my senior year research project, titled 'Predicting success of upcoming Bollywood movies'.

Densely Connected Convolutional Networks
Recent work has shown that convolutional networks can be substantially deeper, more accurate, and efficient to train if they contain shorter connections between layers close to the input and those close to the output. In this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce the Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections - one between each layer and its subsequent layer - our network has L(L+1)/2 direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters. We evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet). DenseNets obtain significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on most of them, whilst requiring less memory and computation to achieve high performance. Code and models are available at this https URL.

DenseNet Architectures
What is a Pre-trained Model?
A pre-trained model has been previously trained on a dataset and contains the weights and biases that represent the features of whichever dataset it was trained on. Learned features are often transferable to different data. For example, a model trained on a large dataset of bird images will contain learned features like edges or horizontal lines that you would be transferable your dataset.
Why use a Pre-trained Model?
Pre-trained models are beneficial to us for many reasons. By using a pre-trained model you are saving time. Someone else has already spent the time and compute resources to learn a lot of features and your model will likely benefit from it."

Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition
Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity.
An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers.
The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.

What is a Pre-trained Model?
A pre-trained model has been previously trained on a dataset and contains the weights and biases that represent the features of whichever dataset it was trained on. Learned features are often transferable to different data. For example, a model trained on a large dataset of bird images will contain learned features like edges or horizontal lines that you would be transferable your dataset.
Why use a Pre-trained Model?
Pre-trained models are beneficial to us for many reasons. By using a pre-trained model you are saving time. Someone else has already spent the time and compute resources to learn a lot of features and your model will likely benefit from it."

Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition
In this work we investigate the effect of the convolutional network depth on its accuracy in the large-scale image recognition setting. Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.

This is a refactored version of https://www.kaggle.com/calmdownkarm/ufcdataset
The original dataset was separated only by fights, not by fights and fighters, replicating the metric columns and making it hard to work with.
Content
Additionally the statistics you would see would be the sum of all the fights BEFORE the fight that is referenced in the row itself. Every time a new fighter appeared their metrics would be NA for their first fight. If you're interested in predicting fights or knowing what metrics are the most important in a fight itself I think it's best separated. So I've undone this so every fight what you see is the statistics for the fight itself. If you want the sum that's easy enough to compute in R or Python.

I started to scrape TripAdvisor reviews for a personal project on Sentiment Analysis. I thought it could be good to share my data on Kaggle, since this can help other with similar ideas.
Content
The dataset represents a corpus of more than 220k reviews scraped from TripAdvisor (in reviews.csv). Accompanying information on the B&Bs (in properties.csv) are also provided.
Each review has the following fields: - review_title, - review_date, - review_rating, - review_text, - review_language, - review_user, - review_id, - property_id
Each property has the following fields: - property_id, - property_name, - property_reviews (the total number of reviews of the B&B), - property_rating (the average rating of the B&B as displayed on TripAdvisor), - property_address, - property_latitude, - property_longitude
The reviews cover a time slice running from 2002 up to the first days of December 2017.
All data has been scraped from TripAdvisor website using CHeSF (the Chrome Headless Scraping Framework). CHeSF is really useful when you have to scrape javascript intensive web pages.

I extracted 20,000 English language tweets relating to #JerusalemEmbassy . In the wake of USA's decision to move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem (December 6, 2017), there has been an outpouring of tweets under this hashtag. This will be a good data set for data scientists interested in politics to carry out sentiment analysis and NLP. The data can be used for data visualization and geo-location based plotting. These tweets were collected on December 9, 2017.
Content
The CSV contains the tweets extracted under #JerusalemEmbassy . The column text contains the actual text of the tweets. Other columns are:
favorited : FALSE means the tweets was not favorited by anyone. TRUE means that people clicked the heart symbol to indicate they liked the content of the tweet
favoriteCount : Number of times the heart symbol was clicked, It will be 0 for the FALSE of the above

Politics and current affairs interest me as as much as data science does (almost!! ). The world is in a state of flux and while maintaining a politically neutral stand I want to see how advances in data science can help us understand current affairs better. Some of the questions that can be answered include:
1) What are the overall sentiments associated with these tweets? (An analysis of 6K English tweets extracted on December 6, 2017 may surprise you: http://completestatisticaldatanalysis.com/o-jerusalem-jerusalemembassy-hashtag-on-december-6-2017/)
2) What are the dominant words that turn up in the word cloud?
3) Where are most of tweets coming from?
4) Which tweets were re-tweeted the most?
5) Which user received the most responses?
6) Was there any difference in the sentiments of tweets emanating from different countries?
7) How did the tweeting and re-tweeting intensity vary over a day?"

This is a set of Wikipedia Title/Content pairs where the content is always based on a person. Maybe person is not the best word, because this set does not necessarily contain humans and the content can be about fictitious characters. I came across this data set by trying to remove this content from my primary set and thought it might be useful to someone else.
Content
There are two columns Wiki_Title and Content. This data was collected through the Wikipedia API and all the content is raw data from wikipedia.page. Content is from page.content and does contain the full page content. The people described can be characters, real people, fake people, humans, non-humans. Although, the majority of this data will be real people.
The Wiki_Title almost always contains the name of the person in the content or their nickname, but I know this is not true 100% of the time. It is too much data for me to verify the 100,000+ examples so I cannot verify all content is in fact about a person/character, but if there are improvements to be made I would like to do so.

Inception-v4, Inception-ResNet and the Impact of Residual Connections on Learning
Very deep convolutional networks have been central to the largest advances in image recognition performance in recent years. One example is the Inception architecture that has been shown to achieve very good performance at relatively low computational cost. Recently, the introduction of residual connections in conjunction with a more traditional architecture has yielded state-of-the-art performance in the 2015 ILSVRC challenge; its performance was similar to the latest generation Inception-v3 network. This raises the question of whether there are any benefit in combining the Inception architecture with residual connections. Here we give clear empirical evidence that training with residual connections accelerates the training of Inception networks significantly. There is also some evidence of residual Inception networks outperforming similarly expensive Inception networks without residual connections by a thin margin. We also present several new streamlined architectures for both residual and non-residual Inception networks. These variations improve the single-frame recognition performance on the ILSVRC 2012 classification task significantly. We further demonstrate how proper activation scaling stabilizes the training of very wide residual Inception networks. With an ensemble of three residual and one Inception-v4, we achieve 3.08 percent top-5 error on the test set of the ImageNet classification (CLS) challenge

Xception: Deep Learning with Depthwise Separable Convolutions
We present an interpretation of Inception modules in convolutional neural networks as being an intermediate step in-between regular convolution and the depthwise separable convolution operation (a depthwise convolution followed by a pointwise convolution). In this light, a depthwise separable convolution can be understood as an Inception module with a maximally large number of towers. This observation leads us to propose a novel deep convolutional neural network architecture inspired by Inception, where Inception modules have been replaced with depthwise separable convolutions. We show that this architecture, dubbed Xception, slightly outperforms Inception V3 on the ImageNet dataset (which Inception V3 was designed for), and significantly outperforms Inception V3 on a larger image classification dataset comprising 350 million images and 17,000 classes. Since the Xception architecture has the same number of parameters as Inception V3, the performance gains are not due to increased capacity but rather to a more efficient use of model parameters.

Densely Connected Convolutional Networks
Recent work has shown that convolutional networks can be substantially deeper, more accurate, and efficient to train if they contain shorter connections between layers close to the input and those close to the output. In this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce the Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections - one between each layer and its subsequent layer - our network has L(L+1)/2 direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters. We evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet). DenseNets obtain significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on most of them, whilst requiring less memory and computation to achieve high performance. Code and models are available at this https URL.

SqueezeNet: AlexNet-level accuracy with 50x fewer parameters and <0.5MB model size
Recent research on deep neural networks has focused primarily on improving accuracy. For a given accuracy level, it is typically possible to identify multiple DNN architectures that achieve that accuracy level. With equivalent accuracy, smaller DNN architectures offer at least three advantages: (1) Smaller DNNs require less communication across servers during distributed training. (2) Smaller DNNs require less bandwidth to export a new model from the cloud to an autonomous car. (3) Smaller DNNs are more feasible to deploy on FPGAs and other hardware with limited memory. To provide all of these advantages, we propose a small DNN architecture called SqueezeNet. SqueezeNet achieves AlexNet-level accuracy on ImageNet with 50x fewer parameters. Additionally, with model compression techniques we are able to compress SqueezeNet to less than 0.5MB (510x smaller than AlexNet).

Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition
In this work we investigate the effect of the convolutional network depth on its accuracy in the large-scale image recognition setting. Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.

Why use a Pre-trained Model?
Pre-trained models are beneficial to us for many reasons. By using a pre-trained model you are saving time. Someone else has already spent the time and compute resources to learn a lot of features and your model will likely benefit from it."

Word2vec is a group of related models that are used to produce word embeddings. These models are shallow, two-layer neural networks that are trained to reconstruct linguistic contexts of words. Word2vec takes as its input a large corpus of text and produces a vector space, typically of several hundred dimensions, with each unique word in the corpus being assigned a corresponding vector in the space. Word vectors are positioned in the vector space such that words that share common contexts in the corpus are located in close proximity to one another in the space.

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles for short trips, typically 30 minutes or less. With the latest technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used. The data consists of BikeShare information for three large cities in the US - New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC.

Character encodings are sets of mappings from raw bits (0‚Äôs and 1‚Äôs) to text characters. When a text encoded with a specific encoder is decoded with a different encoder, it changes the output text. Sometimes this results in completely unreadable text.
This dataset is intended to provide a list of example texts in different character encodings to help you diagnose which file encoding your source file actually in.
Content
This dataset is made up of six text files that represent five different character encodings and six different languages. The character encodings represented in this dataset are ISO-8859-1 (also known as Latin 1),
ASCII, Windows 1251, UTF-16 that has been successfully converted into the UTF-8 and BIG-5. More information on the files is available in the file_guide.csv file.
Each text file contains a header and footer. The body text is delimited by this text:
* START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK [TITLE OF BOOK GOES HERE] *
* END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK [TITLE OF BOOK GOES HERE]*
Acknowledgements:
The texts in this dataset were prepared by Project Gutenberg volunteers. These texts are in the public domain.

The Spoken Wikipedia project unites volunteer readers of Wikipedia articles. Hundreds of spoken articles in multiple languages are available to users who are ‚Äì for one reason or another ‚Äì unable or unwilling to consume the written version of the article. This is time-aligned corpus of these spoken articles, well suited to research and fostering new ways of interacting with the material.
Content:
All spoken articles use a template with slots: filename, speaker, date and revision spoken, ... to insert the audio player and a display of the meta-data on the Wikipedia page. The template also adds spoken articles to a root category. Templates, categories, and meta-data vary between language communities!
The Dutch language portion of this corpus contains 3073 articles read by 145 speakers. There are 224 hours of speech, of which 79 hours is aligned at the word level.
Each article is tokenized into sections, sentences, and tokens. Each token is normalized and the normalization is aligned to the audio. Complete information on the annotation schema can be found in the schema file. For each article, the corpus contains:
audio file(s)
original WikiText
HTML generated by MediaWiki
cleaned and normalized text
alignment between text and audio
meta-information (who, when, what)

Starting with 20 years data scrapped from NUFORC (from 97 to 2017), plus Mr. Ajayrana UFO report dataset (1949 to 2000), my idea was since the beginning to be able to predict, given sight data, which shape the UFO would be. Therefore, besides NUFORC data, I captured data from Wunderground related to those occurrences.

Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition
In this work we investigate the effect of the convolutional network depth on its accuracy in the large-scale image recognition setting. Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.

A pre-trained model has been previously trained on a dataset and contains the weights and biases that represent the features of whichever dataset it was trained on. Learned features are often transferable to different data. For example, a model trained on a large dataset of bird images will contain learned features like edges or horizontal lines that you would be transferable your dataset.

California Housing Prices,Median house prices for California districts derived from the 1990 census.,Cam Nugent,3,"Version 1,2017-11-24","united states
housing
regression analysis",CSV,400 KB,CC0,"1,271 views",250 downloads,9 kernels,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices,"Context
This is the dataset used in the second chapter of Aur√©lien G√©ron's recent book 'Hands-On Machine learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow'. It serves as an excellent introduction to implementing machine learning algorithms because it requires rudimentary data cleaning, has an easily understandable list of variables and sits at an optimal size between being to toyish and too cumbersome.
The data contains information from the 1990 California census. So although it may not help you with predicting current housing prices like the Zillow Zestimate dataset, it does provide an accessible introductory dataset for teaching people about the basics of machine learning.
Content
The data pertains to the houses found in a given California district and some summary stats about them based on the 1990 census data. Be warned the data aren't cleaned so there are some preprocessing steps required! The columns are as follows, their names are pretty self explanitory:
longitude
latitude
housing_median_age
total_rooms
total_bedrooms
population
households
median_income
median_house_value
ocean_proximity
Acknowledgements
This data was initially featured in the following paper: Pace, R. Kelley, and Ronald Barry. ""Sparse spatial autoregressions."" Statistics & Probability Letters 33.3 (1997): 291-297.
and I encountered it in 'Hands-On Machine learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow' by Aur√©lien G√©ron. Aur√©lien G√©ron wrote: This dataset is a modified version of the California Housing dataset available from: Lu√≠s Torgo's page (University of Porto)

Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) is a dicspline centered on implementing practices for environmental protection and safety in a workplace. Energy companies place a strong emphasis on HSE when conducting day to day operations, whether it is on the field or in an office. A major challenge with HSE, however, is monitoring and managing HSE incidents across an enterprise. The common practice for incident management is analyzing detailed incident reports. This can be cumbersome and time-consuming, because in most cases, these reports contain unstructured text. To increase efficiency, companies are seeking technologies that allow them to derive valuable insights from unstructured HSE data efficiently.
Content
This dataset contains abstracts of the accidents and injuries of construction workers from 2015-2017. There is some structured data around the unstructured text abstracts, such as Degree of Injury, Body Part(s) Affected, and Construction End Use.

What is the TSCA Chemical Substances Control Inventory?
Section 8 (b) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) requires EPA to compile, keep current and publish a list of each chemical substance that is manufactured or processed, including imports, in the United States for uses under TSCA. Also called the ‚ÄúTSCA Inventory‚Äù or simply ‚Äúthe Inventory,‚Äù it plays a central role in the regulation of most industrial chemicals in the United States.
The initial reporting period by manufacturers, processors and importers was January to May of 1978 for chemical substances that had been in commerce since January of 1975. The Inventory was initially published in 1979, and a second version, containing about 62,000 chemical substances, was published in 1982. The TSCA Inventory has continued to grow since then, and now lists about 85,000 chemicals.
EPA‚Äôs compilation of the public TSCA Inventory information is updated twice a year to include new and corrected TSCA Inventory chemical listings, and it contains none of the chemical identities claimed as confidential. Thus it is not as complete nor current as the information contained in EPA's TSCA Master Inventory File, which includes the chemical identities claimed as confidential and is updated continuously as new and corrected information is received by EPA. Consequently, for the purposes of TSCA compliance, the TSCA Master Inventory File maintained by EPA's Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics is the only complete and accurate source that can provide authoritative and conclusive information about which chemical substances are currently included in the TSCA Inventory.

Blue plaques are a well-known and very popular permanent historical marker scheme administered in the United Kingdom that has since spread to many other countries in Europe and the world. According to Wikipedia:
A blue plaque is a permanent sign installed in a public place in the United Kingdom and elsewhere to commemorate a link between that location and a famous person or event, serving as a historical marker. The brainchild of British politician William Ewart in 1863, it is the oldest such scheme in the world.
The world's first blue plaques were erected in London in the 19th century to mark the homes and workplaces of famous people. This scheme continues to the present day...the term ""blue plaque"" may be used narrowly to refer to the official English Heritage scheme, but is often used informally to encompass all similar schemes.""

Like most things in my life, it all started with the Bee Movie. I wanted to know what the most popular words were in the film. So I wrote a Python script that found the words used in the movie and the number of times they appear in the script.
Content
Each movie has an associated .csv file where the first column represents the words found in the script for that move and the second column is the number of times that word appears.

Matrices with intermediate results
Following matrices with intermediate results are provided:
accuracy_matrix.csv - matrix with number of correctly classified images for each pair of attack (targeted and non-targeted) and defense
error_matrix.csv - matrix with number of misclassified images for each pair of attack (targeted and non-targeted) and defense
hit_target_class_matrix.csv - matrix with number of times image was classified as specific target class for each pair of attack (targeted and non-targeted) and defense
In each of these matrices, rows correspond to defenses, columns correspond to attack. Also first row and column are headers with Kaggle Team IDs (or baseline ID).
Scores and run time statistics of submissions
Following files contain scores and run time stats of the submissions:
non_targeted_attack_results.csv - scores and run time statistics of all non-targeted attacks
targeted_attack_results.csv - scores and run time statistics of all targeted attacks
defense_results.csv - scores and run time statistics of all defenses
Each row of these files correspond to one submission. Columns have following meaning:
KaggleTeamId - either Kaggle Team ID or ID of the baseline.
TeamName - human readable team name
Score - raw score of the submission
NormalizedScore - normalized (to be between 0 and 1) score of the submission
MinEvalTime - minimum evaluation time of 100 images
MaxEvalTime - maximum evaluation time of 100 images
MedianEvalTime - median evaluation time of 100 images
MeanEvalTime - average evaluation time of 100 images
Notes about the data
Due to team mergers, team name in these files might be different from the leaderboard.
Not all attacks were used to compute scores of defenses and not all defenses were used to compute scores of attacks. Thus if you simply sum-up values in rows/columns of the corresponding matrix you won't obtain exact score of the submission (however number you obtain will be very close to actual score).
Few targeted and non-targeted attacks exceeded 500 seconds time limit on all batches of images. These submissions received score 0 in the official leaderboard. We still were able to compute ""real"" score for these submissions and include it into non_targeted_attack_results.csv and targeted_attack_results.csv files. However these scores are negated in the provided files to emphasize that these submissions violate the time limit."

Safecast Radiation Measurements,80 million radiation readings from volunteers around the world,Safecast,3,"Version 2,2017-12-08|Version 1,2017-11-10",,CSV,3 GB,CC0,754 views,69 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/safecast/safecast,"Context
Safecast is a volunteer driven non-profit organization whose goal is to create useful, accessible, and granular environmental data for public information and research. Begun in response to the nuclear disaster in Japan in March, 2011, Safecast collects radiation and other environmental data from all over the world. All Safecast data is published, free of charge, under a CC0 designation.
The official ‚ÄúSAFECAST data‚Äù published for others to use is collected by Safecast volunteers using professional quality devices. A combination of off the shelf commercial radiation monitors and devices are used in the collection process. Most devices are standardized on the same sensor, the LND7317 which is commonly referred to as the 2‚Ä≥ pancake. This is a highly sensitive piece of equipment that is used by nuclear professionals all over the world.
Content
""Presently we assume the radiation comes from cesium-137 which is the most prevalent isotope still around from nuclear weapons testing and from the accidents at Chernobyl and Fukushima. Based on calibration tests of multiple device designs using the same detector, we've settled on a conversion factor of 334. That is, 334CPM from a bGeigie equates to 1uSv/h.
It would be more accurate to have conversion factors tuned to each locale based on the spectrum of radiation present, but we don't have much of that data and in practice the error is estimated to be relatively small. ""

The dataset contains 2768 unannotated images and a total of 5536 images. This dataset was created with the motive of removing reflection on sunglasses in a selfie and reconstruct the closest possible shade of the sunglasses. The images in the dataset are of varying dimensions and have to be resized for your research. Currently, the ownership of the dataset is shared between me and Dr. Boqing Gong, who is an Assistant Professor at the Centre for Research in Computer Vision at the University of Central Florida. More images will be added to the dataset in the future and I request fellow kagglers to send images to the author to increase the size of the dataset which will help the machine learning and computer vision engineers community.
About the dataset: The dataset is a collection of images of selfies with sunglasses and images with sunglasses to improve the accuracy of face recognition. The dataset contains 2768 unannotated images and a total of 5536 images. The repository also has the code for annotation which is ready to use.
Before executing the program: 1. make sure you have entered the correct address of the folder which contains the images and the saved_images folder.
Once everything works, a window should pop-up showing the image To annotate the image, 1. left-click and drag across the image where you wish to draw the box. 2. To set a dot on the image, double right-click on the image. 3. The coordinates of the red-dot will be stored in a .txt file and will also be displayed in the console. 4. To undo or redraw the rectangle press 'r' key. 5. To show the cropped image, press 'n' key. 6. To show the next image, press 'n' key again. 7. The output file saves the coordinates of the red-dot as a python dictionary so that it is easy to read and manipulate.

We know the amount is far from enough to do some machine learning with good results. That's why we need some help.
For some of the industries, we didn't find enough text (red-color area), Just do it with less sample. And we will try fill them later.
Some description will appear in multiple industry, Such as a plastic company, their products are for automotive industry. So they will be both ""Plastic"" and ""Automotive general parts""
We need some one to train the machine with the material, and result we need is that after we input a ""description"" and it can tell us which industry(industries) it is.
And you might needs to deal with the following situation: ""A furniture manufacturer, they are selling themselves with the real estate and they have a rental vehicle.""

It's not without reason that no less than Tim Berners-Lee himself, the creator of the worldwide web and one of the most preeminent scholars of the Internet, is doing his latest work in getting more government data on the web: in an interview with The New York Times a few years ago he spoke to how even records as mundane as traffic statistics or weather data could drive tinkerers to ""make government run better"".
New York City has been at the forefront of this movement: mayor Bloomberg formalized a citywide analytics team as the Mayor's Office for Data Analytics in 2013, and the effort has continued under Mayor De Blasio, with the city cementing its first Open Data Plan in July 2015. The resultant NYC Open Data Portal is populated with over 1500 datasets. It was, and is, the largest citywide open data portal in the world.

The data are as images and some kind of SWC file which is basically a text file with columns for index, position and width. The kernels show how it can be loaded.
Tasks
The initial task is to segment the streets and their connectivity from the images. Ideally creating a list of points in a similar order to the SWC provided and with a minimal distance between the two center positions.
Secondary tasks include
Automatically Identifying Intersections (useful for self-driving cars and robots that need to navigate streets)

The files on your computer,Crab: A command line tool that scans file data into a SQLite database,cogs,3,"Version 3,2017-01-15|Version 2,2017-01-15|Version 1,2017-01-15",,SQLite,103 MB,Other,"1,096 views",32 downloads,7 kernels,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/cogitoe/crab,"Dataset: The files on your computer.
Crab is a command line tool for Mac and Windows that scans file data into a SQLite database, so you can run SQL queries over it.
e.g. (Win)       C:> crab C:\some\path\MyProject
or  (Mac)        $ crab /some/path/MyProject
You get a CRAB> prompt where you can enter SQL queries on the data, e.g. Count files by extension
SELECT extension, count(*) 
FROM files 
GROUP BY extension;
e.g. List the 5 biggest directories
SELECT parentpath, sum(bytes)/1e9 as GB 
FROM files 
GROUP BY parentpath 
ORDER BY sum(bytes) DESC LIMIT 5;
Crab provides a virtual table, fileslines, which exposes file contents to SQL
e.g. Count TODO and FIXME entries in any .c files, recursively
SELECT fullpath, count(*) FROM fileslines 
WHERE parentpath like '/Users/GN/HL3/%' and extension = '.c'
    and (data like '%TODO%' or data like '%FIXME%')
GROUP BY fullpath;
As well there are functions to run programs or shell commands on any subset of files, or lines within files e.g. (Mac) unzip all the .zip files, recursively
SELECT exec('unzip', '-n', fullpath, '-d', '/Users/johnsmith/Target Dir/') 
FROM files 
WHERE parentpath like '/Users/johnsmith/Source Dir/%'  and extension = '.zip';
(Here -n tells unzip not to overwrite anything, and -d specifies target directory)
There is also a function to write query output to file, e.g. (Win) Sort the lines of all the .txt files in a directory and write them to a new file
SELECT writeln('C:\Users\SJohnson\dictionary2.txt', data) 
FROM fileslines 
WHERE parentpath = 'C:\Users\SJohnson\' and extension = '.txt'
ORDER BY data;
In place of the interactive prompt you can run queries in batch mode. E.g. Here is a one-liner that returns the full path all the files in the current directory
C:>  crab -batch -maxdepth 1 . ""SELECT fullpath FROM files""
Crab SQL can also be used in Windows batch files, or Bash scripts, e.g. for ETL processing.
Crab is free for personal use, $5/mo commercial
See more details here (mac): http://etia.co.uk/ or here (win): http://etia.co.uk/win/about/
An example SQLite database (Mac data) has been uploaded for you to play with. It includes an example files table for the directory tree you get when downloading the Project Gutenberg corpus, which contains 95k directories and 123k files.
To scan your own files, and get access to the virtual tables and support functions you have to use the Crab SQLite shell, available for download from this page (Mac): http://etia.co.uk/download/ or this page (Win): http://etia.co.uk/win/download/
Content
FILES TABLE
The FILES table contains details of every item scanned, file or directory. All columns are indexed except 'mode'
COLUMNS
  fileid (int) primary key  -- files table row number, a unique id for each item
  name (text)               -- item name e.g. 'Hei.ttf'
  bytes (int)               -- item size in bytes e.g. 7502752
  depth (int)               -- how far scan recursed to find the item, starts at 0
  accessed (text)           -- datetime item was accessed
  modified (text)           -- datetime item was modified
  basename (text)           -- item name without path or extension, e.g. 'Hei'
  extension (text)          -- item extension including the dot, e.g. '.ttf'
  type (text)               -- item type, 'f' for file or 'd' for directory
  mode (text)               -- further type info and permissions, e.g. 'drwxr-xr-x'
  parentpath (text)         -- absolute path of directory containing the item, e.g. '/Library/Fonts/'
  fullpath (text) unique    -- parentpath of the item concatenated with its name, e.g. '/Library/Fonts/Hei.ttf'

PATHS
1) parentpath and fullpath don't support abbreviations such as ~ . or ..  They're just strings.
2) Directory paths all have a '/' on the end.
FILESLINES TABLE
The FILESLINES table is for querying data content of files. It has line number and data columns, with one row for each line of data in each file scanned by Crab.
This table isn't available in the example dataset, because it's a virtual table and doesn't physically contain data.
COLUMNS
  linenumber (int)  -- line number within file, restarts count from 1 at the first line of each file
  data (text)       -- data content of the files, one entry for each line
FILESLINES also duplicates the columns of the FILES table: fileid, name, bytes, depth, accessed, modified, basename, extension, type, mode, parentpath, and fullpath. This way you can restrict which files are searched without having to join tables.
Example Gutenberg data
An example SQLite database (Mac data), database.sqlite, has been uploaded for you to play with. It includes an example files table for the directory tree you get when downloading the Project Gutenberg corpus, which contains 95k directories and 123k files.
You can open it with any SQLite shell, or query it with any SQLite query tools, but the virtual tables such as fileslines and support functions such as EXEC() and WRITELN() only work from the Crab shell that you have to download from etia.co.uk.

Each year schools in Pennsylvania are required to report weapons violations, substance abuse, cyber harassment, and other crimes committed during school, at school events, or on a bus (or waiting at a bus stop) to and from school.
The raw data can be found at www.safeschools.state.pa.us
Important: (LEA Types)
The rows in this Dataset include several ""LEA Types"" (Legal Entity Types): ""School"", ""School District"", ""County""... etc. Please note that several Schools may fall under a single ""School District"", and there maybe several ""School Districts"" in a single county. Hence, if you include both ""LEA Types"", the counts could be off.
Key Pennsylvania Safe Schools Legislation
The Safe Schools Act of 1995 (Act 26) was amended in 1997 (Act 30) to mandate annual reporting of all incidents of violence, weapons, alcohol, drugs and tobacco possession to the Department of Education. Local education agencies also are required to develop a Memorandum of Understanding with local law enforcement agencies and provide for other procedural safeguards to enhance school safety. Another amendment to Act 26 (Act 36 of 1999) empowers schools to acquire the tools and resources needed to develop and enhance safe learning environments.

First Quora Dataset Release: Question Pairs,Quora Duplicate or not,SambitSekhar,3,"Version 1,2017-02-14",,CSV,58 MB,ODbL,"3,307 views",148 downloads,13 kernels,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/sambit7/first-quora-dataset,"Today, we are excited to announce the first in what we plan to be a series of public dataset releases. Our dataset releases will be oriented around various problems of relevance to Quora and will give researchers in diverse areas such as machine learning, natural language processing, network science, etc. the opportunity to try their hand at some of the challenges that arise in building a scalable online knowledge-sharing platform. Our first dataset is related to the problem of identifying duplicate questions.
An important product principle for Quora is that there should be a single question page for each logically distinct question. As a simple example, the queries ‚ÄúWhat is the most populous state in the USA?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhich state in the United States has the most people?‚Äù should not exist separately on Quora because the intent behind both is identical. Having a canonical page for each logically distinct query makes knowledge-sharing more efficient in many ways: for example, knowledge seekers can access all the answers to a question in a single location, and writers can reach a larger readership than if that audience was divided amongst several pages.
To mitigate the inefficiencies of having duplicate question pages at scale, we need an automated way of detecting if pairs of question text actually correspond to semantically equivalent queries. This is a challenging problem in natural language processing and machine learning, and it is a problem for which we are always searching for a better solution.
The dataset that we are releasing today will give anyone the opportunity to train and test models of semantic equivalence, based on actual Quora data. We are eager to see how diverse approaches fare on this problem.
Our dataset consists of over 400,000 lines of potential question duplicate pairs. Each line contains IDs for each question in the pair, the full text for each question, and a binary value that indicates whether the line truly contains a duplicate pair. Here are a few sample lines of the dataset:
Here are a few important things to keep in mind about this dataset:
Our original sampling method returned an imbalanced dataset with many more true examples of duplicate pairs than non-duplicates. Therefore, we supplemented the dataset with negative examples. One source of negative examples were pairs of ‚Äúrelated questions‚Äù which, although pertaining to similar topics, are not truly semantically equivalent. The distribution of questions in the dataset should not be taken to be representative of the distribution of questions asked on Quora. This is, in part, because of the combination of sampling procedures and also due to some sanitization measures that have been applied to the final dataset (e.g., removal of questions with extremely long question details).

The original csv file is no longer available, however it can be downloaded in portions by selecting the various features using this portal.
Content
Each feature is 100% categorical data, with some features having 2 categories, while others can have 30+. The data is not completely imputed appropriately (you can thank Stats Canada), so some data preprocessing is required. For instance, categories may have duplicates in the form of '01' and '1', or some data may be formatted as integers while others are formatted as strings. Some data is not known and is marked accordingly in 'drivingLegend.pdf'. Unfortunately, features such as location and impaired driving are not a part of this feature set, however there are plenty of others to work with.

TruMedicines has trained a deep convolutional neural network to autoencode and retrieve a saved image, from a large image dataset based on the random pattern of dots on the surface of the pharmaceutical tablet (pill). Using a mobile phone app a user can query the image datebase and verify the query pill is not counterfeit and is authentic, additional meta data can be displayed to the user: manf date, manf location, drug expiration date, drug strength, adverse reactions etc.
Content
TruMedicines Pharmaceutical images of 252 speckled pill images. We have convoluted the images to create 20,000 training database by: rotations, grey scale, black and white, added noise, non-pill images, images are 292px x 292px in jpeg format
In this playground competition, Kagglers are challenged to develop deep Convolutional Neural Network and hash codes to accurately identify images of pills and quickly retrieved from our database. Jpeg images of pills can be autoencoded using a CNN and retrieved using a CNN hashing code index. Our Android app takes a phone of a pill and sends a query to the image database for a match, then returns meta data abut the pill: manf date, expiration date, ingredients, adverse reactions etc. Techniques from computer vision alongside other current technologies can make recognition of non-counterfeit, medications cheaper, faster, and more reliable.

Context
Electronic medical records contain multi-format electronic medical data that consist of an abundance of medical knowledge. Facing with patients symptoms, experienced caregivers make right medical decisions based on their professional knowledge that accurately grasps relationships between symptoms, diagnosis, and treatments. We aim to capture these relationships by constructing a large and high-quality heterogeneous graph linking patients, diseases, and drugs (PDD) in EMRs.
Content
Specifically, we extract important medical entities from MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) and automatically link them with the existing biomedical knowledge graphs, including ICD-9 ontology and DrugBank. The PDD graph presented is accessible on the Web via the SPARQL endpoint, and provides a pathway for medical discovery and applications, such as effective treatment recommendations.
A subgraph of PDD is illustrated in the followng figure to betterunderstand the PDD graph.

Based on Fisher's linear discriminant model, this data set became a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning such as support vector machines.
Content
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis.[1] It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species.[2] Two of the three species were collected in the Gasp√© Peninsula ""all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus"".[3]
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.

Since July 1, 2016, Connecticut has updated this nightly dataset of every inmate held in jail while awaiting trial. At the time of download, this dataset contains just over one year of data with 1132352 rows of data, where one row is one inmate.
Content
Field Descriptions: * DOWNLOAD DATE: Date in which the data were extracted and reflecting the population for that day.
IDENITIFIER: Individual Inmate Identifier
LATEST ADMISSION DATE: Most recent date in which the inmate has been admitted. In some instances, this may reflect an original date of admission to a correctional facility. Generally, if a date is more than one year old, an inmate should not be considered to have been held for the entire duration of that time.
RACE: Race of inmate
AGE: Age of inmate
BOND AMOUNT: Amount of bond for which the inmate is being held. In some instances, for particularly low (less than $100), this bond amount may be considered a place holder value
OFFENSE: Controlling offense for which the bond amount has been set.
FACILITY: Department of Correction facility where the inmate is currently held.
DETAINER: Denotes whether inmate is being held at the request of another criminal justice agency, or if another agency is to be notified upon release.

As many others I have asked myself if it is possible to use machine learning in order to create valid predictions for football (soccer) match outcomes. Hence I created a dataset consisting of historic match data for the German Bundesliga (1st and 2nd Division) as well as the English Premier League reaching back as far as 1993 up to 2016. Besides the mere information concerning goals scored and home/draw/away win the dataset also includes per site (team) data such as transfer value per team (pre-season), the squad strength, etc. Unfortunately I was only able to find sources for these advanced attributes going back to the 2005 season.
I have used this dataset with different machine learning algorithms including random forests, XGBoost as well as different recurrent neural network architectures (in order to potentially identify recurring patterns in winning streaks, etc.). I'd like to share the approaches I used as separate Kernels here as well. So far I did not manage to exceed an accuracy of 53% consistently on a validation set using 2016 season of Bundesliga 1 (no information rate = 49%).
Although I have done some visual exploration before implementing the different machine learning approaches using Tableau, I think a visual exploration kernel would be very beneficial.
Content
The data comes as an Sqlite file containing the following tables and fields:
Table: Matches
Match_ID (int): unique ID per match
Div (str): identifies the division the match was played in (D1 = Bundesliga, D2 = Bundesliga 2, E0 = English Premier League)
Season (int): Season the match took place in (usually covering the period of August till May of the following year)
Date (str): Date of the match
HomeTeam (str): Name of the home team
AwayTeam (str): Name of the away team
FTHG (int) (Full Time Home Goals): Number of goals scored by the home team
FTAG (int) (Full Time Away Goals): Number of goals scored by the away team
FTR (str) (Full Time Result): 3-way result of the match (H = Home Win, D = Draw, A = Away Win)
Table: Teams
Season (str): Football season for which the data is valid
TeamName (str): Name of the team the data concerns
KaderHome (str): Number of Players in the squad
AvgAgeHome (str): Average age of players
ForeignPlayersHome (str): Number of foreign players (non-German, non-English respectively) playing for the team
OverallMarketValueHome (str): Overall market value of the team pre-season in EUR (based on data from transfermarkt.de)
AvgMarketValueHome (str): Average market value (per player) of the team pre-season in EUR (based on data from transfermarkt.de)
StadiumCapacity (str): Maximum stadium capacity of the team's home stadium
Table: Unique Teams
TeamName (str): Name of a team
Unique_Team_ID (int): Unique identifier for each team
Table: Teams_in_Matches
Match_ID (int): Unique match ID
Unique_Team_ID (int): Unique team ID (This table is used to easily retrieve each match a given team has played in)
Based on these tables I created a couple of views which I used as input for my machine learning models:
View: FlatView
Combination of all matches with the respective additional data from Teams table for both home and away team.
View: FlatView_Advanced
Same as Flatview but also includes Unique_Team_ID and Unique_Team in order to easily retrieve all matches played by a team in chronological order.
View: FlatView_Chrono_TeamOrder_Reduced
Similar to Flatview_Advanced, however missing the additional attributes from team in order to have a longer history including years 1993 - 2004. Especially interesting if one is only interested in analyzing winning/loosing streaks.

Please feel free to use the humble dataset provided here for any purpose you want. To me it would be most interesting if others think that recurrent neural networks could in fact be of help (and even maybe outperform classical feature engineering) in identifying streaks of losses and wins. In the literature I mostly only found example of RNN application where the data were time series in a very narrow sense (e.g. temperature measurements over time) hence it would be interesting to get your input on this question.
Maybe someone also finds additional attributes per team or match which have substantial impact on match outcome. So far I have found the ""Market Value"" of a team to be by far the best predictor when two teams face each other, which makes sense as the market value usually tends to correlate closely with the strength of a team and it's propects at winning"

By June 1950, the U.S. Air Force had constructed a comprehensive historical program. Over half the records in the Air Force Historical Archives consisted of World War II artifacts, including unit histories and combat reports compiled by field historians as they received a steady flow of documents from operational squadrons and wings. The archives team developed experience pouring through intelligence reports, target folders, bomb damage assessments, and statistics to develop hard earned lessons on modern warfare. So from the first day of combat, 25 June, historians embedded within operational commands in Korea knew recording events from the start would be important. In particular, Albert F. Simpson, the Archives' Director, picked up the phone and directly called the headquarters of the Far East Air Forces (FEAF) to request they begin collecting data on all sorties generated in theater. Their statistical services agreed, and began regularly sending typed reports on 20 essential data items:
Group and Squadron designations
Operating base location
Type and model of aircraft
Aborted, airborne, and effective sorties
Number of aircraft lost or damaged to enemy ground, aircraft, or other action
Personnel Killed, Wounded, or Missing in Action
Number of enemy aircraft destroyed or damaged
Number of bombs, rockets, and bullets expended

Matrices with intermediate results
Following matrices with intermediate results are provided:
accuracy_matrix.csv - matrix with number of correctly classified images for each pair of attack (targeted and non-targeted) and defense
error_matrix.csv - matrix with number of misclassified images for each pair of attack (targeted and non-targeted) and defense
hit_target_class_matrix.csv - matrix with number of times image was classified as specific target class for each pair of attack (targeted and non-targeted) and defense
In each of these matrices, rows correspond to defenses, columns correspond to attack. Also first row and column are headers with Kaggle Team IDs (or baseline ID).
Scores and run time statistics of submissions
Following files contain scores and run time stats of the submissions:
non_targeted_attack_results.csv - scores and run time statistics of all non-targeted attacks
targeted_attack_results.csv - scores and run time statistics of all targeted attacks
defense_results.csv - scores and run time statistics of all defenses
Each row of these files correspond to one submission. Columns have following meaning:
KaggleTeamId - either Kaggle Team ID or ID of the baseline.
TeamName - human readable team name
Score - raw score of the submission
NormalizedScore - normalized (to be between 0 and 1) score of the submission
MinEvalTime - minimum evaluation time of 100 images
MaxEvalTime - maximum evaluation time of 100 images
MedianEvalTime - median evaluation time of 100 images
MeanEvalTime - average evaluation time of 100 images
Notes about the data
Due to team mergers, team name in these files might be different from the leaderboard.
Not all attacks were used to compute scores of defenses and not all defenses were used to compute scores of attacks. Thus if you simply sum-up values in rows/columns of the corresponding matrix you won't obtain exact score of the submission (however number you obtain will be very close to actual score).
Few targeted and non-targeted attacks exceeded 500 seconds time limit on all batches of images. These submissions received score 0 in the official leaderboard. We still were able to compute ""real"" score for these submissions and include it into non_targeted_attack_results.csv and targeted_attack_results.csv files. However these scores are negated in the provided files to emphasize that these submissions violate the time limit."

Daikon (Diachronic Corpus),Historic texts from the British Spector news magazine,Liling Tan,3,"Version 1,2017-08-17",,{}JSON,113 MB,CC0,547 views,22 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/alvations/daikon,"Context
The Daikon Corpus was created during the Diachronic Text Evaluation task in SemEval-2015. The task was to create a system that can date a piece of text.
For example, given a text snippet:
‚ÄúDictator Saddam Hussein ordered his troops to march into Kuwait. After the invasion is condemned by the UN Security Council, the US has forged a coalition with allies. Today American troops are sent to Saudi Arabia in Operation Desert Shield, protecting Saudi Arabia from possible attack.‚Äù
The text has clear temporal evidence with reference to a
historical figure (‚ÄúSaddam Hussein‚Äù),
notable organization (‚ÄúUN Security Council‚Äù)
factual event (‚ÄúOperation Desert Shield‚Äù).
Historically, we know that
Saddam Hussein lived between 1937 to 2006,
UN Security Council has existed since 1946
Operation Desert Shield (i.e. the Gulf War) occurred between 1990-1991
Given the specific chronic deicticity (‚Äútoday‚Äù) that indicates that the text is published during the Gulf War, we can conceive that the text snippet should be dated 1990-1991.
Content
The Daikon Corpus is made up of articles from the British Spectator news magazine from year 828 to 2008.
The corpus contains 24,280 articles with 19 million tokens; the token count is calculated by summing the number of whitespaces plus 1 for each paragraph.
The Daikon corpus is saved in the JSON format, where the outer most-structure is a list and the inner data structure is a key-value dictionary/hashmap that contains the:
url: URL where the original article resides
date: Date of the article
body: A list of paragraphs
title: Title of the text
Note: If the url is broken, try removing the .html suffix of the url. e.g. change

Automatic generation of Guard roles,lets build an primer for an automated guard distribution system,Paul Larmuseau,3,"Version 1,2017-08-29","healthcare
business",CSV,189 KB,ODbL,446 views,18 downloads,2 kernels,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/plarmuseau/geowacht,"Context
There are 4933 pharmacies in Belgium, and each pharmacy (in groups) are obliged to create a network of night-guard pharmacies covering complete Belgium. Compare it with a hospital that has 2000 nurses and want's to distribute the burden of the 'night' shift or 'weekend' shifts over the 2000 nurses on an 'equal foot' basis, but here we add a geographical aspect. So its a maximal covering location problem combined with an typical 'personel' planning problem
The challenge...
The distribution of the pharmacies follows certain rules: 11million inhabitants having access to 5000 pharmacies, you can estimate that each pharmacy serves 2200 inhabitants. This is approximately true. You see a glimpse of the guard kalender : blackpoints, feast days, day/night guard (sun/moon)
Each pharmacy is equal and has to do equal number of guards. That is in this description rounded 12 days guard. We give each pharmacy a guard-capital. Meaning when at the end of the year one pharmacy has done 10 days guard, the next year the pharmacy has to do two days guard more. On average each pharmacy is doing 12 days per year. So starting with an equal guard capital. We try to minimize the difference from the mean (mse).
The guard is divided in a day part from 9:00u-22:00 and from 22:00pm to 9:00am as night guard. Each Pharmacy can choose to do guard during 1 day, having 12 days and 6 nights distributed over the year. With at least 2 sunday guards per year and one sunday night. Or each pharmacy can choose to do his guard in blocks of 4 weekdays (Mo-Tu-We-Th /// Fr-Sa-So) Doing at least two midweek blocks and two weekendblocks ending up with 2 day's too much guard capital. From those blocks he get alternating fe the Mo and We a nightshift. Or by example the Fr/So or Sa as nightshift . The nightshifts are also equally distributed. The choice for midweek/weekend or day guard is a freedom indicated in the database. We filled in a random example. Usually the freedom collides with regions. So a dayblock and a nightblock each get one guard point.
Each customer has to find a pharmacy within 20 minutes from his home. On average this rule is easily obeyed, since its possible to find 3-5 pharmacies within 20 minutes in 'city' zones. Its only in very rural zones this rule can be violated. We use a GISS database to correctly calculate the distance and travelling time between each pharmacy. You can use google-api or haversine, internally we have exact data. But within this proof of concept this doesn't matter. Actually highway's are draining more people to a pharmacy, and the algorithm shows the pharmacy as a faster alternative than geographic haversine closer pharmacies. So a very fine tuned model takes this driving speed into account in function of that 20 minutes rule. But here the haversine distance between the closest clusters should give a good approximation. It actually counts only for the case where the 20 minutes rule is 'violated'
If we divide Belgium in 165 clusters there are 30 pharmacies per cluster. Each cluster has 1 pharmacy available for 66000 inhabitants within 20 minutes. This during DAYTIME. (Daytime is defined until 22:00u) At night the scheme HALVES. 82 clusters, with 60 pharmacies per cluster. Each night cluster has then 132.000 inhabitants. The same rule each cluster has 1 pharmacy available. We search to MAXIMIZE the DISTANCE between each guard-pharmacy , so that there is an maximal SPREAD for the guard. This guarantees that customers find very fast a pharmacy. If you think about it,on the Belgium card you can superimpose a 'grid' that is shifting each day and each night selecting a pharmacy in the intersections of the grid. The only interfering element here is that 50% of the pharmacies chooses to have guard in weekend/midweek scheme, and 50% wants day/night guards, hence you have to swap the guard between neighbouring pharmacy's, so the distance rule remains respected.
Each Pharmacy can block 3 weeks of vacation, that is typical during school vacations periods that pharmacy's tend to block periods. We call it black-points; You can generate random 3 weeks school/holiday vacation weeks that are blocked for each pharmacy. The database is filled in with a manual created sample.. Actually the pharmacist can block 3weeks, or 6 weekend and mid/week blocks. Here i simplified to three week (number of week , week of year)
Doing guard on a holiday like Christmas, New Year, Eastern, Sinksen, National Feast Day, is rewarded with an extra guard capital point. Those pharmacies can do as such 1 day less guard. This as a last twitch
What do we need at the end
1¬∞ a database of all pharmacy's and their guard capital points. We tend to minimize the difference with the mean capital points. And usually the current algorithm selects the first the pharmacies in a cluster with the lowest capital points as prime candidate.
2¬∞ a list of guards for all the 165clusters for all 365days, or 60225 guards per year. And a measurement that estimates the distance between all pharmacies. for that day.. The Mean square error of the distance between the pharmacies has to be minimized"

The span character offsets, from corrected OCR'd text.
The text of the span in question.
The counts of individual words, using the tokenization algorithm followed in the paper (FIXME, name of paper). They are stored in a string, with a space separating word-count pairs and a colon separating the word from the count. The word itself is URL-encoded, i.e. a colon is represented as %3A and a percent character as %25.
The date (if available), extracted from the text using regular expressions.
The full GeoJSON of the points and polygons annotated for the span.
The centroid of the points and polygons, computed first by taking the centroid of each polygon and then taking the centroid of the resulting set of annotated points and polygon-centroid points. The centroid is in the form of a size-2 array of longitude and latitude (the same as how points are stored in GeoJSON).
Toponym corpus
The Toponym corpus, otherwise known as WoTR-Topo, is given in two different formats. The first format is JSON format files, split into train and test. Geographic information for toponyms is given by the geojson standard, with annotations done in a stand-off style.
Not everything that has been annotated is guaranteed to be correct. The creators encourage others to correct errors that they find in a branched repository and submit pull requests when corrections are made.

Kwici is a 4m-word corpus drawn from the Welsh Wikipedia as it was on 30 December 2013.
The final pages and articles dump for 2013 was downloaded from the Wikimedia dump page. The WikiExtractor tool written by Giuseppe Attardi and Antonio Fuschetto was then used to extract plain text (discarding markup etc) from the 165Mb dump, resulting in a 33Mb output file. This was tidied by removing remaining XML, blank lines, and blocks of English text.
The text was then split to give into a total of 360,477 sentences, and these were imported into a PostgreSQL database table. The sentences were pruned by removing all items less than 50 characters long, all items containing numbers only (eg timelines), and all duplicates, to give a final total of 204,789 sentences in the corpus.
The file contains the following fields:
id: unique identifier for the sentence;
welsh: the sentence in Welsh;
word_w: the number of words in the Welsh sentence.

Trial and Terror,Database of US Terrorism Prosecutions and Sentencing Information,Jacob Boysen,3,"Version 2,2017-08-16|Version 1,2017-08-16",,CSV,487 KB,CC4,929 views,65 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/trial-and-terror,"Context:
This database of terrorism prosecutions and sentencing information was created using public records including three lists of prosecutions from the U.S. Department of Justice (from 2010, 2014, and 2015), court files available through the federal judiciary‚Äôs case management system, DOJ press releases, and inmate data from the Bureau of Prisons.
Content:
Trevor Aaronson created the first iteration of this database as part of a project funded by the Investigative Reporting Program at the University of California, Berkeley. Mother Jones magazine published that data in 2011, along with accompanying articles, in a package that is still available online. Beginning in 2016, Aaronson and Margot Williams collaborated to update and expand the database, with a new emphasis to include Bureau of Prisons data because so many post-9/11 terrorism defendants had been released. The cases include any prosecutions after September 11, 2001, that the U.S. government labeled as related to international terrorism. The Intercept first published this database on April 20, 2017. For each defendant in the database, U.S. criminal code data related to charges has been categorized according to this legend

Mapping the KKK 1921-1940,Location and Charter Date of over 2000 ‚ÄúKlaverns‚Äù,Jacob Boysen,3,"Version 1,2017-09-16","united states
sociology",CSV,304 KB,CC4,580 views,35 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/mapping-the-kkk,"Context:
Mapping the Klan is a rough timeline of the rise of the second Ku Klux Klan between 1915 and 1940. Each red dot shows a local unit or ""Klavern."" The official numbers for each Klavern indicate a basic chronology for the chartering of the Klaverns, and they also reveal patterns of Klan organizing.
Content:
The data for Mapping the Klan is based on a variety of sources, mostly newspapers sponsored by or sympathetic to the Ku Klux Klan. These publications reported on the activities of local units, known officially as Klaverns. Data includes approximate date of charter, location(lat/lon), nickname, source for data, and related notes.
Dates: The dates for each Klavern come from the publication listed for that entry. So, it is likely that the Klaverns identified were established even earlier than the date indicated. The Klan‚Äôs recruitment methods make it harder to accurately date the beginning of a Klavern. Each local group had to recruit a set number of members before it could get its charter and number.
Numbers: The Klaverns in each state were numbered in chronological order of their chartering. So we can assume that if a Klan number 40 is dated October 1923, Klans 1 to 39 were established before 1923.
As historians agree, the busiest years of Klan expansion were 1922-1924, with big declines thereafter. The large number of klaverns established after 1925, when the Ku Klux Klan largely disappeared from the national news media, is intriguing. The continued organizing of Klaverns after 1925 is more difficult to study, for lack of sources. That history remains to be explored. Learn more.

The wmt15_eval dataset contains the files to machine translation evaluation output from Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT15).
NLTK uses this dataset to validate the machine translation BLEU score implementations.
Content
The wmt15_eval directory contains the files to evaluate MT evaluation metrics, it's not production standards data, neither will it be helpful in shared task participation but it provides a good testbed for new metrics implementation and comparison against metrics already available in nltk.translate.*_score.py to validate the numbers.
It includes the first 100 sentences from the newstest 2015 development set for the English-Russian language part, made available at Workshop for Machine Translation 2016 (WMT16) and the Google Translate of the English source sentences.
[Plaintext]
newstest-2015-100sents.en-ru.src.en

And the original ,sgm files from WMT16:
newstest2015-enru-ref.ru.sgm
newstest2015-enru-src.en.sgm
The plaintext are converted from the .sgm files from the development sets in WMT with the following command:
sed -e 's/<[^>]*>//g; /^\s*$/d' newstest-2015.enru.src.en.sgm | head -n100 > newstest-2015-100sents.en-ru.src.en

The tokenized versions of the natural text files above are processed using Moses tokenizer.perl:
~/mosesdecoder/scripts/tokenizer/tokenizer.perl -l ru < newstest-2015-100sents.en-ru.ref.ru > ref.ru
~/mosesdecoder/scripts/tokenizer/tokenizer.perl -l ru < newstest-2015-100sents.en-ru.google.ru > google.ru
~/mosesdecoder/scripts/tokenizer/tokenizer.perl -l en < newstest-2015-100sents.en-ru.src.en > src.en
The Google translate outputs are created on 25 Oct 2016 10am. using the English source sentences.
The newstest2015-100sents-enru-google.ru.sgm is created using the wrap-xml.perl tool in Moses:
~/mosesdecoder/scripts/ems/support/wrap-xml.perl ru newstest2015-100sents-enru-src.en.sgm Google < google.ru > newstest2015-100sents-enru-google.ru.sgm
The BLEU scores output from multi-bleu.perl is as such:
~/mosesdecoder/scripts/generic/multi-bleu.perl ref.ru < google.ru 
BLEU = 23.17, 53.8/29.6/17.6/10.3 (BP=1.000, ratio=1.074, hyp_len=1989, ref_len=1852)
The mteval-13a.output file is produced using the mteval-v13a.pl
~/mosesdecoder/scripts/generic/mteval-v13a.pl -r newstest2015-100sents-enru-ref.ru.sgm -s newstest2015-100sents-enru-src.en.sgm -t newstest2015-100sents-enru-google.ru.sgm  > mteval-13a.output

Asbestos Clean-up in Poland,Is Poland on track to be free of asbestos by 2032?,Obrocka,3,"Version 1,2018-02-14",pollution,CSV,122 KB,CC0,232 views,27 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/pinsleepe/asbestos-cleanup-in-poland,"Context
First, what is asbestos? Well it is a mineral that can be pulled into fine fibres with high resistance to heat, electricity and chemical corrosion. In the past it was a common ingredient in construction materials (caveat: this is at least true for the European Union). Why in the past? Asbestos is a threat to health due to its very fibre structure. Those microscopic fibers can become trapped in the respiratory system, causing cancer and other disease decades after exposure.
Second, where is Poland?! The answer depends on how grumpy the internet is on that day. My home country, Poland, is located in the Eastern or Central Europe. Poland joined the European Union in 2004 and suddenly stuff was required of her. Strangely enough, Poland is the only European country that plans to be free of asbestos by 2032. The National Asbestos Cleaning Program program was initiated in 2009 with one of the aims to create a complete database of asbestos contamination by 2012. In this blog post I‚Äôm hoping to shed some light on the progress of this ambitious plan.
Content
The database is run by the Ministry of Development and should be updated yearly. It was originally uploaded on March 21st 2016 and then updated 8 months later. As far as I can see they don‚Äôt keep older versions. The spreadsheet contains columns with the total number of asbestos in the given location (in kilograms), how much of that has been utilised (also in kilograms) and how much still needs to be utilised (not kidding). There is also name of the place and its code TERYT. TERYT translates as the National Official Register of the Territorial Division of the Country. It is a very useful thing in identifying cities and regions, especially for languages that include certain letters with diacritics, the overdot, the tail and the stroke. As a side note, TERYT code for asbestos dataset was incomplete i.e. missing the last digit (!). In addition, there was no metadata that describes the data collection process or time when it was taken.

Context
Recently I have been working on some object localization problems using Convolutional Nets and I wanted to try train the model on a new dataset other than the very common COCO or PASCAL VOC datasets. While pondering on what object to compile a small dataset around, I thought of pushing the challenge a bit more to see if the same model can be trained to localize faces. Having this in mind I wanted a dataset of a person's face annotations.
As you may know with Deep Learning models, the more data you have the more accuracy you reach. So considering the challenge to detect a face I wanted a considerable number of images of the same face that the model should be trained on.
Hence, I needed many pictures of the same person. So the person had to be famous so I could easily find many pictures. So being in Sri Lanka where else to look other than our Cricket stars. So I chose the living legend in Sri Lankan Cricket, Kumar Sangakkara.
Content
I downloaded around 1000 images from google images and after manual cleaning ended up with 704, which are contained here. I manually annotated all the pictures using a python script to generate the xml files. (Yeah, I couldn't find a better thing to do in that 2 hours.) Now here is the dataset for anyone to make use of.
The zip file attached contains two folders, images and annotations.
Inspiration
So as I mentioned in the above description, my goal with this dataset was to see if an object localization model can be used to detect a face of a person. Even though I have the pipeline, I couldn't still thoroughly test its performance using a GPU. So anyone whose interested can use this dataset to test those results. Also if these annotations can be useful for any other application, feel free to use it and share it. Have fun!"

Data breaches. Incidents in the world, that compromised more than 30000 records, between 2004 and 2017. English version. I wanted to visualize the data including the possibility to compare numbers between variable levels. I did some improvements in levels of variables as well as data, and I did a visualization. I also uploaded this version of the dataset in Spanish. I did the visualization with Tableau software.
In this post in my blog, you can read more about it: Spanish version and English version. You can also see the visualization in this link: Spanish version and English version.

The dataset has 270 observations and 11 variables. Most of them, are categorical variables. Incidents happened between 2004 and 2017. Last updated: February 2018. Format: CSV2.
Variables (columns) [EN]:
Entity: name of the organization (public or private) that had the breach. String
Alternative Name: other known names of the entity. String
Story: tells a summary of what happened. String
Year: year of the breach. Date
Records Lost: number of records that the breach compromised.Integer

Inspiration
The main question to be answered with the data visualization was ""What quantities of records were compromised by important data breaches, in organizations and sectors, between 2004 and 2017, and what was the reason?"". I wanted to have a visual answer that allows to compare numbers between year, sector, and method of leak. It would be great to improve the dataset adding new variables for data mining in the future. Achieving a complete and exhaustive ""Data Breaches 2004-2017"" dataset, would help to an in-depth analysis of incidents in this period. 2017 has been the worst year in the history."

Data Set Information:
Two datasets are provided. the original dataset, in the form provided by Prof. Hofmann, contains categorical/symbolic attributes and is in the file ""german.data"".
For algorithms that need numerical attributes, Strathclyde University produced the file ""german.data-numeric"". This file has been edited and several indicator variables added to make it suitable for algorithms which cannot cope with categorical variables. Several attributes that are ordered categorical (such as attribute 17) have been coded as integer. This was the form used by StatLog.
This dataset requires use of a cost matrix (see below)
..... 1 2
1 0 1
2 5 0
(1 = Good, 2 = Bad)
The rows represent the actual classification and the columns the predicted classification.
It is worse to class a customer as good when they are bad (5), than it is to class a customer as bad when they are good (1).

Indoor Temp Over an Oven and Cooktop,Monitoring usage of cooking appliance to identify risks,Ray Dickenson,2,"Version 2,2018-02-14|Version 1,2018-02-14",,CSV,110 KB,CC0,112 views,3 downloads,2 kernels,,https://www.kaggle.com/rdickenson/cooktoptemp,"Context
Using measurements from an indoor temperature sensor mounted over a cooktop, can you help monitor the welfare of an elderly person who wants to live at home later in life?
Content
Indoor Temperature over the Cooktop
The dataset contains temperature measurements from an indoor sensor mounted 30cm over a combination cooktop-oven. Data were collected over a 100 day period. Measurements were recorded only when the temperature changed by 1 degree C or more and at a minimum of every 15 minutes.
Outside Temperature and Relative Humidity
Also included are outside air temperatures and relative humidity collected in the same region during the same period.
Other factors include:
The data include round-the-clock measurements including typical meal preparation times and long periods (overnight) when the kitchen is not being used.
Ambient temperature in the house varies between 15C - 30C.
The home may be under air conditioning or with the windows and sliding doors open when outside temperature and humidity allow it; use the associated climate data to help determine which state the house is in.
When the air conditioning is in use, the thermostat keeps the house between 24C - 25C.
There is an incandescent light bulb about 20cm over the sensor that may be on or off for long periods.
First use of the cooktop is typically to prepare coffee between 05:30 and 07:00; any absence of this event is likely an indicator of trouble.
Acknowledgements
Indoor temperatures were collected in a home setting by the poster. Outdoor temperature and humidity are accessed from the National Climatic Data Center, U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN/USRCRN), via anonymous ftp at: ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/uscrn/products/hourly02
Inspiration
Can you help monitor the welfare of elderly residents of a home so they can safely live independently later in life? Can you establish a profile of typical use of the oven and cooktop and then detect anomalies that signal the occupant(s) are in trouble and may need help? If so, a simple monitoring system can alert family members to check on their elderly parents or grand parents.
Can you detect these trouble events, that exist in this dataset and possibly in future data? - A saucepan was left on the cooktop too long creating a fire hazard - Normal meal preparation patterns have been interrupted requiring a check on the occupant(s)"

Why are school shootings (and death counts) increasing over time?
How does the risk of being killed in a school shooting compare with other risks?
Are some schools / cities / states at higher risk?
Is there a correlation between countermeasures and a decrease in fatalities?
What else correlates with school shooting risks? In addition to firearms and the people who wield them, is there any clear causality?"

The Austin Animal Center is the largest no-kill animal shelter in the United States that provides care and shelter to over 18,000 animals each year and is involved in a range of county, city, and state-wide initiatives for the protection and care of abandoned, at-risk, and surrendered animals.
As part of the City of Austin Open Data Initiative, the Austin Animal Center makes available its collected dataset that contains statistics and outcomes of animals entering the Austin Animal Services system.
The dataset was explored in a series of Jupyter Notebooks that end with a pipeline prediction model written in scikit-learn. The series of notebooks can be viewed here:
Part One - Downloading, Cleaning and Feature Engineering the AAC Shelter Outcome dataset
Part Two - Exploratory Data Analysis of Shelter Cat Outcomes with Pandas and Seaborn
Content
The dataset contains shelter outcomes of several types of animals and breeds from 10/1/2013 to the present with a hourly time frequency. The data is updated daily.
The Austin Animal Center's original dataset has the following column entries:
Animal ID
Name
DateTime
MonthYear
Date of Birth
Outcome Type

Inspiration
The inspiration for sharing this dataset and the associated notebooks is to spread awareness and provide another set of data to help support and care for the animals who need it most. By increasing the amount of data and knowledge around best practices and data analysis, those in the animal welfare community can more effectively respond and identify animals that need more support to avoid unwanted outcomes."

Judging by the examples, one would expect this to be a harder task than MNIST. This seems to be the case -- logistic regression on top of stacked auto-encoder with fine-tuning gets about 89% accuracy whereas same approach gives got 98% on MNIST. Dataset consists of small hand-cleaned part, about 19k instances, and large uncleaned dataset, 500k instances. Two parts have approximately 0.5% and 6.5% label error rate. I got this by looking through glyphs and counting how often my guess of the letter didn't match it's unicode value in the font file.

"13,000 Screen Capture Images + How to Get More","13,000 Screen Caps Scraped from prnt.sc, Plus Description of How to Collect More",Mitchell J,2,"Version 1,2017-08-31","artificial intelligence
internet",Other,498 MB,Other,411 views,28 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/lightshot,"Story
This is a set of 13,000 images from the site https://prnt.sc/. It is a site that enables users to easily upload images, either through the web interface, or, most commonly, through the downloadable screen cap tool which enables easy selection and uploading of an area of your screen. As you can see on their homepage, at the point of posting this, they have almost a billion images uploaded. The amount of information in there will be incredible, it‚Äôs an information enthusiast dream. Around 2 years ago I discovered this, and I thought it was interesting to mass download these images with a tool I created, but I was manually looking at every single image. As I became more interested in machine learning, I figured experimenting with the 20,000 or so images I had downloaded at the time from the site would be interesting, especially since because of the nature of the site and its ease of access, it gets used for a few very specific purposes which is very useful for image categorisation. Video games are an extremely popular use, pictures of people, animations, screenshots of chats and the most popular; debugging or technical help. Anyone in this field knows people are not particularly conscious of where they put information. I‚Äôm sure you can imagine some of the interesting nuggets of info in here just waiting to be found. I was able to find a fair amount just using a retrained Inception CNN and some OCR. I manually categorised just over 5,600 images into 6 categories:
Animations
Games
Objects
People
Text
A very specific kind of animated game character uploaded frequently enough to deserve its own category
I was able to achieve around 85% accuracy for categorisation with the rest of the image set (I have 1,000,000 images downloaded from the site total) using just those manually categorised 5,609 images.
Image Collection
The way an image is assigned its link on their site is what made it easy to scan and scrape images from their site. The URL codes are generated sequentially out of a combination letters and numbers of length 6, i.e. prnt.sc/jkl123 prnt.sc/jkl124 prnt.sc/jkl125 prnt.sc/jkl126 Would represent images uploaded one after another. This is of course very easy to write a script to scrape and collect images from. So far I have collected 1,000,000 images in total, and I am now making as many of them as I could available here, but of course you can imagine how easy it would be to collect massive amounts of images from this site. My images were collected over the last 2 years, although the vast majority were collected within the last 4 months.
Copyright
The LightShot terms of service, including their stance on copyright: https://app.prntscr.com/en/privacy.html
Inspiration
This image set is interesting because it represents a balance between a completely random and chaotic set of images and a very structured set of images, due to the fact that there is a great amount of variance image to image, but essentially every image can be categorised into a set of very specific purposes that the site is used for. Because of this, it is good for learning and testing out image processing models.
It is essentially an information gatherers gold mine. There are 1 billion screenshots uploaded by everyday users to be collected and processed on this site, all available sequentially. I‚Äôm sure you can imagine the kinds of easily accessible (to a machine learning enthusiast) information waiting to be collected on this site."

VADER Sentiment Analysis. VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media, and works well on texts from other domains.
The VADER lexicon is an empirically validated by multiple independent human judges, VADER incorporates a ""gold-standard"" sentiment lexicon that is especially attuned to microblog-like contexts.
The documentation of the lexicon and the algorithm can be found from the original implementation: https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment
The NLTK port has slight modification to integrate with the NLTK interfaces and it comes with better Python3 support: https://github.com/nltk/nltk/blob/develop/nltk/sentiment/vader.py

The maxent_ne_chunker contains two pre-trained English named entity chunkers trained on an ACE corpus (perhaps ACE ACE 2004 Multilingual Training Corpus?)
It will load an nltk.chunk.named_entity.NEChunkParser object and it is used by the nltk.ne_chunk() function.
Robert M. Johnson has written an excellent expository of what the pre-trained model is doing under the hood
From the relation extraction code function in NLTK, it lists the following tags for the ACE tagset:
LOCATION
ORGANIZATION
PERSON
DURATION
DATE
CARDINAL
PERCENT
MONEY
MEASURE
FACILITY
GPE
Content
The maxent_ne_chunker.zip contains - english_ace_binary.pickle: Chunks the input POS tagged sentence and labeled positive NEs as NE. - english_ace_multiclass.pickle: Chunks the input POS tagged sentence and outputs the repsective NE labels under the ACE tagset. - PY3: Subdirectory that contains the Python3 compatiable pickles as above

linguistics",{}JSON,579 MB,CC4,558 views,43 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/rajasankar/similar-sentences-clustered-data,"Description
This dataset has two parts, one is created using 100 Million sentences from last 18 months of US Patent data downloaded from USPTO site. Second is from 83 Million sentences extracted from NCBI PMC open access articles.
Preparation of Data
Text from original XML extracted using Python lxml module. Extracted text split into sentences using simple regex. Resulting 83 Million sentences from PMC articles, 120 Million sentences from Patents.
Clustering of Sentences
Sentences with less than 5 words and more than 70 words were removed. Stop words and unwanted characters were removed. Extracted sentences were fed to the Clustering Algorithm to generate Hierarchical Clusters.
Sentences are clustered as if each sentence is compared with all other sentences, ie all against all match. However, all against all match for 100 Million sentences computationally may not be possible, even extracting features would be costly, graph mining algorithms used to cluster the data.

Where this data can be used?
This can be used in Search Ranking of Similar Documents, Conceptual Search, Plagiarism Detection etc. Having similar sentences can improve the accuracy of the prediction models. Machine translation and other areas where alignment is needed, running models on already aligned data can boost the accuracy while reducing the time.
Details about the uploaded data
Original Data size uncompressed is 32 GB for NCBI PMC data, 30 GB for USPTO data. Clustered data size is slightly bigger than original, so it cant be uploaded in Kaggle.
Only Clusters with less than 5/8 lines were uploaded, consisting of 400k and 358 clusters for NCBI and USPTO respectively. Each has more than 800k lines in 250k and 135k documents.

Past Usage:

In the above reference, the output ""area"" was first transformed with a ln(x+1) function. Then, several Data Mining methods were applied. After fitting the models, the outputs were post-processed with the inverse of the ln(x+1) transform. Four different input setups were used. The experiments were conducted using a 10-fold (cross-validation) x 30 runs. Two regression metrics were measured: MAD and RMSE. A Gaussian support vector machine (SVM) fed with only 4 direct weather conditions (temp, RH, wind and rain) obtained the best MAD value: 12.71 +- 0.01 (mean and confidence interval within 95% using a t-student distribution). The best RMSE was attained by the naive mean predictor. An analysis to the regression error curve (REC) shows that the SVM model predicts more examples within a lower admitted error. In effect, the SVM model predicts better small fires, which are the majority.
Relevant Information:
This is a very difficult regression task. It can be used to test regression methods. Also, it could be used to test outlier detection methods, since it is not clear how many outliers are there. Yet, the number of examples of fires with a large burned area is very small.
Number of Instances: 517
Number of Attributes: 12 + output attribute

These datasets contain estimated speed and estimated trip durations for all trips generated by the fastest route dataset from oscarleo. The estimated trip durations are a better approximation for the actual trip duration than the total_travel_time variable from the fastest route dataset is.
How these features are generated in detail can be found in this kernel: https://www.kaggle.com/pepeeee/nyc-estimating-avg-speed-using-fastest-route/notebook
Content
estimated_speed - This variable contains the estimated average speed of the respective trip. The unit of this variable is meter per second.
estimated_trip_duration - This variable is generated by dividing the total_distance variable of the fastest route dataset by estimated_speed. The unit of the variable is seconds.

The file presents a listing of characters wearing powered armor / mini or giant meccha in movies, comics, animation etc.
The purpose was to analyse our imaginaries in a specific field (i.e armors in this case) in order to see what are the macro elements, see how they evolve around time and if they are close to what is used in real life.
Content
Each armor is analyzed according to 13 characteristics (uses an AI or not, what kind or power, where is the weapon, its capacities (does is fly, gives enhanced strength etc.). Being a social science professor and not a data analysts, I went on marvel wikia, DC wikia etc. to compile it. Something like 80 heroes are fully presented, and a list of almost 300 been found.
Inspiration
Coming from social science I compiled that data during my free time, but I understand that it is highly limiting and that there must be a way to aggregate much more data, & faster. Also, I am sure that it does not meet some of the standards for such work. Being a newbie here, please tell me how to improve this & I will.
The question after is to know if we can ""predict"" what future armors will look like : is there a trend showing that AI is used more and more ? That they all fly ? Once this done, it would allow to ""delineate"" the ideal characteristics of a super hero and hence, where we could innovate if we do not want to reproduce things that already done while imagining them ?
The last questions correlate to social trends : do some characteristics appear during a certain period ? If yes, is it correlated to some specific social context ? (new type of wars impacting how we imagine our heroes ?)."

These are just supplementary datasets which I plan on using for plotting county wise data on maps.. (in particular for using with my kernel : https://www.kaggle.com/stansilas/maps-are-beautiful-unemployment-is-not/)
As that data set didn't have the info I needed for plotting an interactive map using highcharter .

Since I noticed that most demographic datasets here on Kaggle, either have state code, state name, or county name + state name but not all of it i.e county name, fips code, state name + state code.
Using these two datasets one can get any combination of state county codes etc.
States.csv has State name + code

Some words, like ‚Äúthe‚Äù or ‚Äúand‚Äù in English, are used a lot in speech and writing. For most Natural Language Processing applications, you will want to remove these very frequent words. This is usually done using a list of ‚Äústopwords‚Äù which has been complied by hand.
Content:
This project uses the source texts provided by the African Storybook Project as a corpus and provides a number of tools to extract frequency lists and lists of stopwords from this corpus for the 60+ languages covered by ASP.
Included in this dataset are the following languages:
Afrikaans: stoplist and word frequency
Hausa: stoplist and word frequency
Lugbarati: word frequency only
Lugbarati (Official): word frequency only
Somali: stoplist and word frequency
Sesotho: stoplist and word frequency
Kiswahili: stoplist and word frequency
Yoruba: stoplist and word frequency
isiZulu: stoplist and word frequency
Files are named using the language‚Äôs ISO code. For each language, code.txt is the list of stopwords, and code_frequency_list.txt is word frequency information. A list of ISO codes the the languages associated with them may be found in ISO_codes.csv.

Matrices with intermediate results
Following matrices with intermediate results are provided:
accuracy_matrix.csv - matrix with number of correctly classified images for each pair of attack (targeted and non-targeted) and defense
error_matrix.csv - matrix with number of misclassified images for each pair of attack (targeted and non-targeted) and defense
hit_target_class_matrix.csv - matrix with number of times image was classified as specific target class for each pair of attack (targeted and non-targeted) and defense
In each of these matrices, rows correspond to defenses, columns correspond to attack. Also first row and column are headers with Kaggle Team IDs (or baseline ID).
Scores and run time statistics of submissions
Following files contain scores and run time stats of the submissions:
non_targeted_attack_results.csv - scores and run time statistics of all non-targeted attacks
targeted_attack_results.csv - scores and run time statistics of all targeted attacks
defense_results.csv - scores and run time statistics of all defenses
Each row of these files correspond to one submission. Columns have following meaning:
KaggleTeamId - either Kaggle Team ID or ID of the baseline.
TeamName - human readable team name
Score - raw score of the submission
NormalizedScore - normalized (to be between 0 and 1) score of the submission
MinEvalTime - minimum evaluation time of 100 images
MaxEvalTime - maximum evaluation time of 100 images
MedianEvalTime - median evaluation time of 100 images
MeanEvalTime - average evaluation time of 100 images
Notes about the data
Due to team merging these files contain slightly more submissions than reflected in leaderboard.
Also not all attacks were used to compute scores of defenses and not all defenses were used to compute scores of attacks. Thus if you simply sum-up values in rows/columns of the corresponding matrix you won't obtain exact score of the submission (however number you obtain will be very close to actual score)."

Every retail business in the world faces a fundamental question: how much inventory should I carry? In one hand to mush inventory means working capital costs, operational costs and a complex operation. On the other hand lack of inventory leads to lost sales, unhappy customers and a damaged brand.
Current inventory management models have many solutions to place the correct order, but they are all based in a single unknown factor: the demand for the next periods.
This is why short-term forecasting is so important in retail and consumer goods industry.
We encourage you to seek for the best demand forecasting model for the next 2-3 weeks. This valuable insight can help many supply chain practitioners to correctly manage their inventory levels."

linguistics",CSV,43 MB,Other,573 views,54 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/docsouth-data/first-person-narratives-of-the-american-south,"""First-Person Narratives of the American South"" is a collection of diaries, autobiographies, memoirs, travel accounts, and ex-slave narratives written by Southerners. The majority of materials in this collection are written by those Southerners whose voices were less prominent in their time, including African Americans, women, enlisted men, laborers, and Native Americans.
The narratives available in this collection offer personal accounts of Southern life between 1860 and 1920, a period of enormous change. At the end of the Civil War, the South faced the enormous challenge of re-creating their society after their land had been ravaged by war, many of their men were dead or injured, and the economic and social system of slavery had been abolished. Many farmers, confronted by periodic depressions and market turmoil, joined political and social protest movements. For African Americans, the end of slavery brought hope for unprecedented control of their own lives, but whether they stayed in the South or moved north or west, they continued to face social and political oppression. Most African Americans in the South were pulled into a Darwinistic sharecropper system and saw their lives circumscribed by the rise of segregation. As conservative views faced a growing challenge from Modernist thought, Southern arts, sciences, and religion also reflected the considerable tensions manifested throughout Southern society. Admidst these dramatic changes, Southerners who had lived in the antebellum South and soldiers who had fought for the Confederacy wrote memoirs that and strived to preserve a memory of many different experiences. Southerners recorded their stories of these tumultuous times in print and in diaries and letters, but few first-person narratives, other than those written by the social and economic elite found their way into the national print culture. In this online collection, accounts of life on the farm or in the servants' quarters or in the cotton mill have priority over accounts of public lives and leading military battles. Each narrative offers a unique perspective on life in the South, and serves as an important primary resource for the study of the American South. The original texts for ""First-Person Narratives of the American South"" come from the University Library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which includes the Southern Historical Collection, one of the largest collections of Southern manuscripts in the country and the North Carolina Collection, the most complete printed documentation of a single state anywhere. The DocSouth Editorial Board, composed of faculty and librarians at UNC and staff from the UNC Press, oversees this collection and all other collections on Documenting the American South.
Context
The North American Slave Narratives collection at the University of North Carolina contains 344 items and is the most extensive collection of such documents in the world.
The physical collection was digitized and transcribed by students and library employees. This means that the text is far more reliable than uncorrected OCR output which is common in digitized archives.
More information about the collection and access to individual page images can be be found here: http://docsouth.unc.edu/neh
The plain text files have been optimized for use in Voyant and can also be used in text mining projects such as topic modeling, sentiment analysis and natural language processing. Please note that the full text contains paratextual elements such as title pages and appendices which will be included in any word counts you perform. You may wish to delete these in order to focus your analysis on just the narratives.
The .csv file acts as a table of contents for the collection and includes Title, Author, Publication Date a url pointing to the digitized version of the text and a unique url pointing to a version of the text in plain text (this is particularly useful for use with Voyant: http://voyant-tools.org/).

About the DocSouth Data Project
Doc South Data provides access to some of the Documenting The American South collections in formats that work well with common text mining and data analysis tools.
Documenting the American South is one of the longest running digital publishing initiatives at the University of North Carolina. It was designed to give researchers digital access to some of the library‚Äôs unique collections in the form of high quality page scans as well as structured, corrected and machine readable text.
Doc South Data is an extension of this original goal and has been designed for researchers who want to use emerging technology to look for patterns across entire texts or compare patterns found in multiple texts. We have made it easy to use tools such as Voyant (http://voyant-tools.org/) to conduct simple word counts and frequency visualizations (such as word clouds) or to use other tools to perform more complex processes such as topic modeling, named-entity recognition or sentiment analysis."

Wiki Words,Word Count from 1 Million Wikipedia Pages,dataist,2,"Version 6,2017-03-08|Version 5,2017-03-08|Version 4,2017-03-08|Version 3,2017-03-08|Version 2,2017-03-08|Version 1,2017-02-17",,CSV,927 KB,Other,"1,497 views",89 downloads,2 kernels,,https://www.kaggle.com/dataistic/wiki-words,"Context
Human communication abilities have greatly evolved with time. Speech/Text/Images/Videos are the channels we often use to communicate, store/share information.""Text"" is one of the primary modes in formal communication and might continue to be so for quite some time.
I wonder, how many words, a person would Type in his lifetime, when he sends an email/text message or prepare some documents. The count might run into millions. We are accustomed to key-in words, without worrying much about the 'Effort' involved in typing the word. We don't bother much about the origin of the word or the correlation between the meaning and the textual representation. 'Big' is actually smaller than 'Small' just going by the words' length.
I had some questions, which, I thought, could be best answered by analyzing the BIG data we are surrounded with today. Since the data volume growing at such high rates, can we bring about some kind of optimization or restructuring in the word usage, so that, we are benefited in terms of Data storage, transmission, processing. Can scanning more documents, would provide better automated suggestions in email / chats, based on what word usually follows a particular word, and assist in quicker sentence completion.
What set of words, in the available text content globally, if we can identify and condense, would reduce the overall storage space required.
What set of words in the regular usage, email/text/documents, if we condense, would reduce the total effort involved in typing (keying-in the text) and reduce the overall size of the text content, which eventually might lead to lesser transmission time, occupy less storage space, lesser processing time for applications which feed on these data for analysis/decision making.
To answer these, we may have to parse the entire web and almost every email/message/blog post/tweet/machine generated content that is in or will be generated in every Phone/Laptop/Computer/Servers, Data generated by every person/bot. Considering tones of text lying around in databases across the world Webpages/Wikipedia/text archives/Digital libraries, and the multiple versions/copies of these content. Parsing all, would be a humongous task. Fresh data is continually generated from various sources. The plate is never empty, if the data is cooked at a rate than the available processing capability.
Here is an attempt to analyze a tiny chunk of data, to see, if the outcome is significant enough to take a note of, if the finding is generalized and extrapolated to larger databases.
Content
Looking out for a reliable source, I could not think of anything better than the Wikipedia database of Webpages. Wiki articles are available for download as html dumps, for any offline processing. https://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/static_html_dumps/, the dump which I downloaded is a ~40 GB compressed file (that turned in ~208 GB folder containing ~15 million files, upon extraction).
With my newly acquired R skills, I tried to parse the html pages, extract the distinct words with their total count in the page paragraphs.I could consolidate the output from the ""first million"" of html files out of available 15 million. Attached dataset ""WikiWords_FirstMillion.csv"" is a Comma Separated file with the list of words and their count. There are two columns - word and count. ""word"" column contains distinct words as extracted from the paragraphs in the wiki pages and ""count"" column has the count of occurrence in one million wiki pages. Non-Alphanumeric characters have been removed at the time of text extraction.
Any array of characters separated by space are included in the list of words and the count has been presented as is without any filters. To get better estimates, it should be OK to make suitable assumptions, like considering root words, ignoring words if they appear more specific to Wikipedia pages (Welcome, Wikipedia, Articles, Pages, Edit, Contribution.. ).

In case, the entire English Language community across the world decides to designate every alphabet as a word [Apart from 'A' and 'I' all other alphabets seem to be potential candidates to be a word, a one-lettered word],
(a) Which of the 24 words from the data set are most eligible to get upgraded as a one letter word. Assuming, it is decided to replace the existing words with the newly designated one-lettered word, to achieve storage efficiency.
(b) Assuming, the word count in the data set is a fair estimate of the composition of the words available in the global text content, (Say we do a ""Find"" and ""Replace"" on global text content). If the current big data size is 3 Exabytes (10 ^ 18), and say 30% of it is text content, how much space reduction can be achieved with (a), assuming 1 character requires 1 byte of storage space.
(c) Suppose, it is decided to accommodate 10 short cut keys for 10 different words,one short cut key for each word. Which 10 words would increase the speed of text documentation assuming, (1) same amount of time is taken to type any word (2) time required to type a word increases with its length

Vectorized Handwritten Digits,Redefining MNIST. A new approach to an old problem.,Donfuzius,2,"Version 1,2017-03-06",,CSV,103 KB,CC0,842 views,37 downloads,8 kernels,,https://www.kaggle.com/donfuzius/vectordigits,"Context
I recently implemented an iPhone App for my younger daughter to learn multiplication. It probably was as much of a learning exercise for me as it was for her. But now I want to tackle the next challenge and add some more smarts with a module to recognise her handwritten digits. Instead of taking a pixel based approach, I took the opportunity of the touch-based input device to record the training data as vectorized paths.
Content
The data contains 400 paths for digits along with their matching labels. Each path is normalized to 20 vectors (2d) and the total length of the vectors is normalized to ~100. Find an example record of the JSON-structure below:
{ ""Items"": [ {""y"":1, ""id"": 1488036701781, ""p"": [[0,0],[1,-2],[7,-9],[3,-5],[6,-9],[2,-3],[3,-4],[1,-1],[1,-1],[0,0],[0,2],[0,10],[0,8],[0,17],[0,6],[0,10],[0,3],[0,3],[0,0],[-1,1]] }] }

The United States Constitution provides that the president ""shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for..."" (Article II, section 2). This provision, like many others in the Constitution, was born of compromise, and, over the more than two centuries since its adoption, has inspired widely varying interpretations.
The president nominates all federal judges in the judicial branch and specified officers in cabinet-level departments, independent agencies, the military services, the Foreign Service and uniformed civilian services, as well as U.S. attorneys and U.S. marshals. The importance of the position, the qualifications of the nominee, and the prevailing political climate influence the character of the Senate's response to each nomination. Views of the Senate's role range from a narrow construction that the Senate is obligated to confirm unless the nominee is manifestly lacking in character and competence, to a broad interpretation that accords the Senate power to reject for any reason a majority of its members deems appropriate. Just as the president is not required to explain why he selected a particular nominee, neither is the Senate obligated to give reasons for rejecting a nominee.

This dataset (ml-20m) describes 5-star rating and free-text tagging activity from MovieLens, a movie recommendation service. It contains 20000263 ratings and 465564 tag applications across 27278 movies. These data were created by 138493 users between January 09, 1995 and March 31, 2015. This dataset was generated on October 17, 2016.
Users were selected at random for inclusion. All selected users had rated at least 20 movies. No demographic information is included. Each user is represented by an id, and no other information is provided.
The data are contained in six files, genome-scores.csv, genome-tags.csv, links.csv, movies.csv, ratings.csv and tags.csv. More details about the contents and use of all these files follows.

Content and Use of Files
Verifying the Dataset Contents
We provide a MD5 checksum with the same name as the downloadable .zip file, but with a .md5 file extension. To verify the dataset:
on linux
md5sum ml-20m.zip; cat ml-20m.zip.md5
on OSX
md5 ml-20m.zip; cat ml-20m.zip.md5
windows users can download a tool from Microsoft (or elsewhere) that verifies MD5 checksums
Check that the two lines of output contain the same hash value.
Formatting and Encoding
The dataset files are written as comma-separated values files with a single header row. Columns that contain commas (,) are escaped using double-quotes (""). These files are encoded as UTF-8. If accented characters in movie titles or tag values (e.g. Mis√É¬©rables, Les (1995)) display incorrectly, make sure that any program reading the data, such as a text editor, terminal, or script, is configured for UTF-8.
User Ids
MovieLens users were selected at random for inclusion. Their ids have been anonymized. User ids are consistent between ratings.csv and tags.csv (i.e., the same id refers to the same user across the two files).
Movie Ids
Only movies with at least one rating or tag are included in the dataset. These movie ids are consistent with those used on the MovieLens web site (e.g., id 1 corresponds to the URL https://movielens.org/movies/1). Movie ids are consistent between ratings.csv, tags.csv, movies.csv, and links.csv (i.e., the same id refers to the same movie across these four data files).
Ratings Data File Structure (ratings.csv)
All ratings are contained in the file ratings.csv. Each line of this file after the header row represents one rating of one movie by one user, and has the following format: userId,movieId,rating,timestamp
The lines within this file are ordered first by userId, then, within user, by movieId.
Ratings are made on a 5-star scale, with half-star increments (0.5 stars - 5.0 stars).
Timestamps represent seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.
Tags Data File Structure (tags.csv)
All tags are contained in the file tags.csv. Each line of this file after the header row represents one tag applied to one movie by one user, and has the following format:
userId,movieId,tag,timestamp The lines within this file are ordered first by userId, then, within user, by movieId.
Tags are user-generated metadata about movies. Each tag is typically a single word or short phrase. The meaning, value, and purpose of a particular tag is determined by each user.
Timestamps represent seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.
Movies Data File Structure (movies.csv)
Movie information is contained in the file movies.csv. Each line of this file after the header row represents one movie, and has the following format:
movieId,title,genres Movie titles are entered manually or imported from https://www.themoviedb.org/, and include the year of release in parentheses. Errors and inconsistencies may exist in these titles.
Genres are a pipe-separated list, and are selected from the following:
Action
Adventure
Animation
Children's
Comedy
Crime
Documentary
Drama
Fantasy
Film-Noir
Horror
Musical
Mystery
Romance
Sci-Fi
Thriller
War
Western
(no genres listed)
Links Data File Structure (links.csv)
Identifiers that can be used to link to other sources of movie data are contained in the file links.csv. Each line of this file after the header row represents one movie, and has the following format:
movieId,imdbId,tmdbId movieId is an identifier for movies used by https://movielens.org. E.g., the movie Toy Story has the link https://movielens.org/movies/1.
imdbId is an identifier for movies used by http://www.imdb.com. E.g., the movie Toy Story has the link http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/.
tmdbId is an identifier for movies used by https://www.themoviedb.org. E.g., the movie Toy Story has the link https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/862.
Use of the resources listed above is subject to the terms of each provider.
Tag Genome (genome-scores.csv and genome-tags.csv)
This data set includes a current copy of the Tag Genome.
The tag genome is a data structure that contains tag relevance scores for movies. The structure is a dense matrix: each movie in the genome has a value for every tag in the genome.
As described in this article, the tag genome encodes how strongly movies exhibit particular properties represented by tags (atmospheric, thought-provoking, realistic, etc.). The tag genome was computed using a machine learning algorithm on user-contributed content including tags, ratings, and textual reviews.
The genome is split into two files. The file genome-scores.csv contains movie-tag relevance data in the following format:
movieId,tagId,relevance The second file, genome-tags.csv, provides the tag descriptions for the tag IDs in the genome file, in the following format:
tagId,tag The tagId values are generated when the data set is exported, so they may vary from version to version of the MovieLens data sets.
Cross-Validation
Prior versions of the MovieLens dataset included either pre-computed cross-folds or scripts to perform this computation. We no longer bundle either of these features with the dataset, since most modern toolkits provide this as a built-in feature. If you wish to learn about standard approaches to cross-fold computation in the context of recommender systems evaluation, see LensKit for tools, documentation, and open-source code examples."

osu! is a music rythm game that has 4 modes (check for more infos). In this dataset you can examine the rankings of the standard mode, taken on 26/03/2017 around 12PM. Ranking is based on pp (performance points) awarded after every play, which are influenced by play accuracy and score; pps are then summed with weights: your top play will award you the whole pp points of the map, then the percentage is decreased (this can maintain balance between strong players and players who play too much). You can find here many other statistics.
Content
The dataset contains some columns (see below) reporting statistics for every player in the top100 of the game in the standard mode. The ranking are ordered by pp. Some players seem to have the same points, but there are decimals which are not shown in the ranking chart on the site

A Visual and Intuitive Train-Test Pattern,How good is your algorithm? A visual inspection of machine learning,Oscar Takeshita,2,"Version 1,2017-04-19","data visualization

While studying neural networks in machine learning, I found an ingenious 2-D scatter pattern at the cn231 course by Andrej Karpathy. Decision boundaries for the three classes of points cannot be straight lines. He uses it to compare the behavior of a linear classifier and a neural network classifier. Often, we are content with the percentage of accuracy of our prediction or classification algorithm but a visualization tool helps our intuition about the trends and behavior of the classifier. It was definitely useful to catch something strange in the last example of this description. How does your preferred method or algorithm do with this input?
Content
The 2D scatter train pattern is a collection of 300 points with (X,Y) coordinates where -1<X,Y<1.
The 300 points are divided into 3 classes of 100 points each whose labels are 0, 1 and 2. Each class is an arm in the spiral.
The test file is simply a grid covering a square patch within the (X,Y) coordinate boundaries. The idea is to predict and assign labels to each point and visualize the decision boundaries and class areas.
The train pattern is provided in two formats: libsvm and csv formats. The test pattern is also provided in the above formats.
If you want to reproduce the data yourself or modify parameters, either run the python script in cn231 or you may check PicoNN out for a C++ version.
Here's the output I get with the neural network classifier PicoNN
An SVM classifier with radial basis kernel yields the following output. It looks better than the above neural network one.
An SVM classifier with linear kernel yields the following output. One can see it won't handle curved decision regions.
An SVM classifier with polynomial kernel yields the following output. Interestingly it decided to bundle the center of the spiral.
An SVM classifier with sigmoid kernel yields the following output. There is definitely something going on. A bug in my code? I could had wrongfully discarded this kernel for bad accuracy. Visualization was definitely useful for this case.
Acknowledgements
I thank Andrej Karpathy for making his excellent cn231 machine learning course freely available.
Inspiration
I was happy with the result of the 100-node neural network. I then tested with libsvm obtaining similar results. How do other algorithms do with it? Would you draw yourself a different decision boundary?"

In this study, large number of National Stock Exchange(NSE), India stocks under different sectors are mined from various financial websites and data analytic steps are followed. Primary goal of this work is to explore the hidden context patterns between diverse group of stocks and discover the predictive analytic knowledge using machine learning algorithms. The transaction dataset are captured for NSE stocks using statistical computing software R. The price of the stock is determined by the market forces. Buyers and sellers quote the preferred price, so there is a dynamic data day by day. Though it is difficult to identify when to buy and sell the stock, technical indicators may support us to forecast the future price

In an attempt to provide transparency to the population of Brazil, the dadosaberto initiative publishes data on different topics related to the House of Deputies. Among those informations, is the amount of refunds requested by each deputy, on expenses related to their activities.
This dataset compiles those expenses from 2009 to 2017, translate the categories to english, fix some dates (missing, invalid) for analysis purpouses, and discards some information thats not useful.
There are some issues with the dataset provided by the initiative dadosabertos;
the dates are related to the receipt, not to the actual refund request.
parties/states relations to the candidate sometimes are missing
social security numbers sometimes are missing.
social security should always have length == 11 for a person or == 14 for a company. that doesnt happen.
among other issues.
Ive converted dates that were missing or corrupted with only the year. Ive also created a OHE column to help identify/filter those dates.
Content:
bugged_date: (binary) identify wether date had issues receipt_date: (datetime) receipt date // (int year) for when bugged_date == 1 deputy_id: (deputy_id) id number. (didnt check if it changed across year/legislation period for deputies) political_party: (string) deputy political party state_code: (string) Brazil's state that elected the deputy deputy_name: (string)
receipt_social_security_number: might be a persons SS number (11 digits long) or a business id number (14 digits long). Many cases with issues. receipt_description: (str / classes) class of spending under which the receipt fits establishment_name: (string) receipt_value: (int) $BR, 3BR$ ~ 1USD

I have only slightly fiddled with the dataset, but there are some funny patterns to say the least. Brazil faces a huge problem with corruption and neglect with public funds, this dataset helps to show that.
I invite fellow kagglers to toy with the dataset, try to identify suspicious spendings as well as odd patterns.
PS: This is a more complete version of a dataset i posted a year ago, which did not include translations or other years spendings."
Data Scientists vs Size of Datasets,Hardware & Brain battle between data set size and data scientists,Laurae,2,"Version 1,2016-10-18",,CSV,6 KB,Other,"1,786 views",37 downloads,2 kernels,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/laurae2/data-scientists-vs-size-of-datasets,"This research study was conducted to analyze the (potential) relationship between hardware and data set sizes. 100 data scientists from France between Jan-2016 and Aug-2016 were interviewed in order to have exploitable data. Therefore, this sample might not be representative of the true population.
What can you do with the data?
Look up whether Kagglers has ""stronger"" hardware than non-Kagglers
Whether there is a correlation between a preferred data set size and hardware
Is proficiency a predictor of specific preferences?
Are data scientists more Intel or AMD?
How spread is GPU computing, and is there any relationship with Kaggling?
Are you able to predict the amount of euros a data scientist might invest, provided their current workstation details?
I did not find any past research on a similar scale. You are free to play with this data set. For re-usage of this data set out of Kaggle, please contact the author directly on Kaggle (use ""Contact User""). Please mention:
Your intended usage (research? business use? blogging?...)
Your first/last name
Arbitrarily, we chose characteristics to describe Data Scientists and data set sizes.
Data set size:
Small: under 1 million values
Medium: between 1 million and 1 billion values
Large: over 1 billion values
For the data, it uses the following fields (DS = Data Scientist, W = Workstation):
DS_1 = Are you working with ""large"" data sets at work? (large = over 1 billion values) => Yes or No
DS_2 = Do you enjoy working with large data sets? => Yes or No
DS_3 = Would you rather have small, medium, or large data sets for work? => Small, Medium, or Large
DS_4 = Do you have any presence at Kaggle or any other Data Science platforms? => Yes or No
DS_5 = Do you view yourself proficient at working in Data Science? => Yes, A bit, or No
W_1 = What is your CPU brand? => Intel or AMD
W_2 = Do you have access to a remote server to perform large workloads? => Yes or No
W_3 = How much Euros would you invest in Data Science brand new hardware? => numeric output, rounded by 100s
W_4 = How many cores do you have to work with data sets? => numeric output
W_5 = How much RAM (in GB) do you have to work with data sets? => numeric output
W_6 = Do you do GPU computing? => Yes or No
W_7 = What programming languages do you use for Data Science? => R or Python (any other answer accepted)
W_8 = What programming languages do you use for pure statistical analysis? => R or Python (any other answer accepted)
W_9 = What programming languages do you use for training models? => R or Python (any other answer accepted)
You should expect potential noise in the data set. It might not be ""free"" of internal contradictions, as with all researches."

This dataset lists the natural rate of unemployment (NAIRU) in the U.S., which is the rate of unemployment arising from all sources except fluctuations in aggregate demand. Estimates of potential GDP are based on the long-term natural rate. The short-term natural rate incorporates structural factors that are temporarily boosting the natural rate beginning in 2008. The short-term natural rate is used to gauge the amount of current and projected slack in labor markets, which is a key input into CBO's projections of inflation.

Aberdeen, Scotland: Morgan Kaufmann. -- Size of data set: only 369 instances (at that point in time) -- Applied 4 instance-based learning algorithms -- Collected classification results averaged over 10 trials -- Best accuracy result: -- 1-nearest neighbor: 93.7% -- trained on 200 instances, tested on the other 169 -- Also of interest: -- Using only typical instances: 92.2% (storing only 23.1 instances) -- trained on 200 instances, tested on the other 169
Relevant Information:
Samples arrive periodically as Dr. Wolberg reports his clinical cases. The database therefore reflects this chronological grouping of the data. This grouping information appears immediately below, having been removed from the data itself:
Group 1: 367 instances (January 1989) Group 2: 70 instances (October 1989) Group 3: 31 instances (February 1990) Group 4: 17 instances (April 1990) Group 5: 48 instances (August 1990) Group 6: 49 instances (Updated January 1991) Group 7: 31 instances (June 1991) Group 8: 86 instances (November 1991)
Total: 699 points (as of the donated datbase on 15 July 1992)
Note that the results summarized above in Past Usage refer to a dataset of size 369, while Group 1 has only 367 instances. This is because it originally contained 369 instances; 2 were removed. The following statements summarizes changes to the original Group 1's set of data:

Rouse Tek Bio informatics Cytogenomics Project is an attempt to bring the human genome to the understanding of how cancers develop. All of our bodies are composed of cells. The human body has about 100 trillion cells within it. And usually those cells behave in a certain fashion. They observe certain rules, they divide when they‚Äôre told to divide, they‚Äôre quiescent when they‚Äôre told to remain dormant, they stay within a particular position within their tissue and they don‚Äôt move out of that.
Occassionally however, a single cell, of those 100 trillion cells, behave in a different way. That cell keeps dividing when all its signals around it tell it to stop dividing. That cell ignores its counterparts around it and pushes them out of the way. That cell stops observing the rules of the tissue within which it is located and begins to move out of its normal position, invading into the tissues around it and sometimes entering the bloodstream and becoming a metastasis, depositing in another tissue of the body..
The reason the cell has gone rogue is because it has acquired within its genome, within its DNA, a number of abnormalities that cause it to behave as a cancer cell.
All 100 trillion cells in the human body have got a copy of the human genome, they have 2 copies, 1 maternal, 1 paternal. Throughout Life all those copies of the genome in those 100 trillion cells, are acquiring abnormal changes or somatic mutations. These mutations are present in the cell and are not transmitted from parents to offspring. They are constrained to that individual cell. Those mutations occur in every cell of the body, normal and abnormal, for a number of different reasons. They occur because every time a cell divides possibly one letter of code out of 3 billion is replicated incorrectly. And that‚Äôs 1 source of somatic mutations.
Another source is that our 100 trillion cells are being exposed to a number of different onslaughts like radiation, self generated chemicals from inhalation of things like tobacco smoke or even an unhealthy diet over time. Occasionally mechanisms in a particular cell make breakdown and the DNA of that cell begins to acquire somatic mutations rather more commonly than other cells.
So in summary, every cell in the body acquires mutations throughout a lifetime, and as we get older we acquire more and more somatic mutations in which occasionally a particular type of gene is mutated where the protein that it makes is abnormal and drives the cell to behave in a rogue fashion that we call cancer."

The subject of this dataset is multi-instrument observations of solar flares. There are a number of space-based instruments that are able to observe solar flares on the Sun; some instruments observe the entire Sun all the time, and some only observe part of the Sun some of the time. We know roughly where flares occur on the Sun but we don't know when they will occur. In this respect solar flares resemble earthquakes on Earth. This dataset is a catalog of which solar flares have been observed by currently operational space-based solar observatories.
Content
It includes that start time and end time of each solar flare from 1 May 2010 to 9 October 2017 and which instrument(s) they were observed by. It was collected by doing a retrospective analysis of the known pointing of seven different instruments with the location and times of 12,455 solar flares.
Acknowledgements
The dataset was compiled by Dr. Ryan Milligan based on publicly available data and are freely distributed. The citation of relevance is https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04412.
Inspiration
This dataset represents the first attempted evaluation of how well space-based instrumentation co-ordinate when it comes to observing solar flares. We are particularly interested in understanding how often combinations of instruments co-observe the same flare. The ultimate purpose is to try to find strategies that optimize the scientific return on solar flare data given the limited space-based instrument resources available. More often than not, our greatest understanding of these explosive events come through simultaneous observations made by multiple instruments."

After participating in many Kaggle competitions, we decided to open-source our Python AutoML framework AlphaPy. You can configure models using YAML, and it's a quick way to develop a classification or regression model with any number of scikit-learn algorithms. More importantly, we needed the ability to easily write custom transformations to engineer features that could be imported by other tools such as H2O.ai and DataRobot, which are commercial AutoML tools.
We were very interested in predicting the stock market and sporting events, so we developed some tools for collecting end-of-day stock market data and then transforming that time series data for machine learning. For the sports data, we painstakingly entered game results on a daily basis, and this dataset (albeit limited) is the result. Sports APIs such as Sportradar are becoming more prevalent, but you still need a pipeline to merge all that data to shape it for machine learning.
Content
We collected game results, line, and over/under data for the following sports and seasons:
NFL 2014, 2015 (2 Seasons)
NBA 2015-16 (1 Season)
NCAA Football 2015-16 (1 Season)
NCAA Basketball 2015-16 (1 Season)
Using AlphaPy, we developed a sports pipeline to analyze trend data in the game results. You can find documentation and examples here.

Penalty kicks in football are the easiest, and perhaps most elegant way of modelling a game theory situation in a real-world scenario. Given the limited number of options for both kickers and keepers, it makes for wonderful real-life data, which can be used in a professional context. However, official match records do not record the interesting aspects of the play - the direction of the kicker, the direction the keeper moves, where the ball lands, and so on. I watched all the penalties of the 2016/17 season of the EPL (thanks, Youtube!) and tagged the direction each player moves in. I believe this dataset will be extremely valuable to those who wish to experiment at the intersection of sports, game theory and data science.
Content
The dataset contains information of all 106 penalty kicks taken during the 2016/17 season of the English Premier League, with the following details - teams involved, player who took the kick, his foot, the direction the ball went, and the direction the keeper dove in [IMPORTANT: Direction is with reference to the kicker!], and what time the penalty was awarded. The saved column indicates whether the keeper saved it, or the kicker kicked it beyond the goal post.
There is missing data for 3 kicks - for one, the penalty was nullified due to a double kick, and for the other two, I simply couldn't find any video evidence of them. (If you do find them, please let me know). Also, please let me know if you find any other errors with the data.

Before joining the federal executive administration, new government appointees must submit, amongst other things, detailed information regarding their finances and previous job history. Such disclosure rules are in place in order to prevent conflicts of interest, and are a fundamental part of the work done by government ethics commissions.

In the early 2000s, Billy Beane and Paul DePodesta worked for the Oakland Athletics. While there, they literally changed the game of baseball. They didn't do it using a bat or glove, and they certainly didn't do it by throwing money at the issue; in fact, money was the issue. They didn't have enough of it, but they were still expected to keep up with teams that had much deeper pockets. This is where Statistics came riding down the hillside on a white horse to save the day. This data set contains some of the information that was available to Beane and DePodesta in the early 2000s, and it can be used to better understand their methods.
Content
This data set contains a set of variables that Beane and DePodesta focused heavily on. They determined that stats like on-base percentage (OBP) and slugging percentage (SLG) were very important when it came to scoring runs, however they were largely undervalued by most scouts at the time. This translated to a gold mine for Beane and DePodesta. Since these players weren't being looked at by other teams, they could recruit these players on a small budget. The variables are as follows:
Team
League
Year
Runs Scored (RS)
Runs Allowed (RA)

On-Base Percentage (OBP)
Slugging Percentage (SLG)

It is such an important skill in today's world to be able to see the ""truth"" in a data set. That is what DePodesta was able to do with this data, and it unsettled the entire system of baseball recruitment. Beane and DePodesta defined their season goal as making it to playoffs. With that in mind, consider these questions:
How does a team make the playoffs?
How does a team win more games?
How does a team score more runs?
They are all simple questions with simple answers, but now it is time to use the data to find the ""truth"" hidden in the numbers."

Human Activity Recognition - HAR - has emerged as a key research area in the last years and is gaining increasing attention by the pervasive computing research community (see picture below, that illustrates the increasing number of publications in HAR with wearable accelerometers), especially for the development of context-aware systems. There are many potential applications for HAR, like: elderly monitoring, life log systems for monitoring energy expenditure and for supporting weight-loss programs, and digital assistants for weight lifting exercises.
Content
This human activity recognition research has traditionally focused on discriminating between different activities, i.e. to predict ""which"" activity was performed at a specific point in time (like with the Daily Living Activities dataset above). The approach we propose for the Weight Lifting Exercises dataset is to investigate ""how (well)"" an activity was performed by the wearer. The ""how (well)"" investigation has only received little attention so far, even though it potentially provides useful information for a large variety of applications,such as sports training.
ix young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions: exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E).
Class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes. Participants were supervised by an experienced weight lifter to make sure the execution complied to the manner they were supposed to simulate. The exercises were performed by six male participants aged between 20-28 years, with little weight lifting experience. We made sure that all participants could easily simulate the mistakes in a safe and controlled manner by using a relatively light dumbbell (1.25kg).

Engineers use numerical models to analyze the behavior of the systems they are studying. By means of numerical models you can prove whether a design is safe or not, instead of making a prototype and testing it. This gives you great flexibility to modify parameters and to find a cheaper design that satisfies all the safety requirements.
But when the models are too complex, the numerical simulations can easily last from a few hours to a few days. In addition, during the optimization process you might need a few tens of trials. So in order to simplify the process we can build a simple 'surrogate' model that yields similar results to the original one. Here's when Machine Learning comes in!
Content
The dataset contains the data of about 6000 numerical simulations (finite element models, FEM). It must be pointed out that there is no noise in the data, that is, if we run again the simulations we'd get the same results. There are 9 input parameters and 4 output results.
Inputs (continuous and positive values): (1) load parameters: ecc, N, gammaG. (2) material parameters: Esoil, Econc. (3) geometry parameters: Dbot, H1, H2, H3.
Outputs (continuous values): (1) stress related results: Mr_t, Mt_t, Mr_c, Mt_c.

The data comes from deterministic numerical simulations. Under this circumstance, is there any way we can find a regression model that gives accurate results? Let's say something like 5% error (True_value / Predicted_value within the range of [0.95, 1.05]).
What would be the most appropriate regression algorithms? What accuracy can we expect?"

The need for music-speech classification is evident in many audio processing tasks which relate to real-life materials such as archives of field recordings, broadcasts and any other contexts which are likely to involve speech and music, concurrent or alternating. Segregating the signal into speech and music segments is an obvious first step before applying speech-specific or music-specific algorithms. Indeed, speech-music classification has received considerable attention from the research community (for a partial list, see references below) but many of the published algorithms are dataset-specific and are not directly comparable due to non-standardised evaluation.
Content

To ensure that data are temporally uncorrelated, we sample a frame every two seconds from multiple video streams. We extracted 2400 frames in total.
We manually labeled 2400 frames under different vehicle categories. The number of available frames reduced to 1417 after careful scrutiny and elimination of unclear images. We initially defined eight different vehicle classes commonly seen in Indian traffic. Few of these classes were similar while two classes had less number of labeled instances; these were merged into similar looking classes. For example, in our dataset, we had different categories for small car, SUV, and sedan which were merged under the light motor vehicle (LMV) category.
A total of 6319 labeled vehicles are available in the collected dataset. This includes 3294 two-wheelers, 279 heavy motor vehicles (HMV), 2148 cars, and 598 auto-rickshaws. A second dataset was created by merging cars and auto-rickshaws together into light motor vehicle (LMV) class. Approximately 25.2\% of vehicles were occluded."

Automated composition of computer programs has been a standing challenge since the early days of artificial intelligence, and has no clear solutions with modern-day research in deep learning. Indeed, modeling latent context representations in language proves to be a difficult task singularly, and combined with applying structured procedural knowledge in a generative fashion quickly becomes intractable for complex domain specific languages. There is a clear need for research in devising efficiently learned combinations of these independent problems. We present this basic dataset of elementary mathematical functions encoded in the python programming language to encourage future research in this field, and to benchmark our own deep learning
Content
This dataset contains a total of 335922 elementary mathematical functions with examples for inputs with corresponding outputs. The first line in the dataset csv file contains a header describing the contents of each column. The first column is labeled function_name, and the following rows contains a function name with a unique integer index. The next twenty columns contain function_input_X and function_output_X for all integers between 0 and 9 inclusively, where the following rows contains string encoded python floating point numbers after executing the corresponding function. The final column is labeled function_code, and contains a single-line lambda statement elementary mathematical function.

The company list is from the publicly available 1st November 2017 Companies House snapshot.
The SIC code descriptions are from the gov.uk website.
In the file AllCompanies.csv each row is formatted as follows:

IncorporationDate - in British date format, dd/mm/yyyy
SIC - 5 digits or if not known, None - see separate file for description of each code.

Possible uses for this data is to use ML to suggest a new unique but suitable name for a company based on what other companies of the same SIC are called.
Perhaps analyse how company names have evolved over time.
Using ML, perhaps determine what a typical company name looks like, maybe analyse if company names have got longer or more complicated over time.
I am sure there are many more possible uses for this data in ways, that I cannot imagine.

Data is organized into columns representing the survey year, age range, sex of participants, and education level. For example, [1995, 18_24, Male, ...] represents the 1995 survey for men ages 18-24.
It's worth noting that the surveys varied somewhat in granularity. The 2015 survey divided categories more finely (18-24, 25-29, 29-34...) while the 2005 and 1995 surveys were coarser (18-24, 25-34, ...). This could create some distortion depending on the analysis used.

Songs Emotion,,Sandy HE,2,"Version 1,2018-01-15",emotion,CSV,57 MB,Other,259 views,15 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/sandyhe/songs-emotion,"Context
It is about recognizing songs emotion. Generally, for songs, audio features and lyrics could be used. For ground truth data, it tends to use online tags if dataset scale is large. Otherwise, music experts or trained candidates could be organized to label songs emotion.
Content
Here songs data is from The Million Song Dataset (MSD). It contains almost 1 million songs data. And in the stage1, only tempo, loudness and mode are extracted for analysis as audio feature. For checking convenience, artist and title are added.
For ground truth data, tags from lastfm is adopted.
For two sets of data mentioned above, some preprocessing work is done. If you have more interests, you can find all original data here. https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/pages/getting-dataset
songs data and tags data could be connected by track_id.
In the further stage, timbre and pitch could be used in an appropriate way, especially related to time-series analysis. Adding genre, similarity or other features to assist songs emotion prediction.
Acknowledgements
The Million Song Dataset was created under a grant from the National Science Foundation, project IIS-0713334. The original data was contributed by The Echo Nest, as part of an NSF-sponsored GOALI collaboration. Subsequent donations from SecondHandSongs.com, musiXmatch.com, and last.fm, as well as further donations from The Echo Nest, are gratefully acknowledged.
Inspiration
Use this dataset to do some exploratory data analysis, predict emotion for songs if you like."

The scraper goes through the restaurants listing pages and fulfills a raw dataset. The raw datasets for the main cities in Europe have been then curated for futher analysis purposes, and aggregated to obtain this dataset.
The scraper is a Python script, available on the GitHub repository here.
It uses principally pandas and BeautifulSoup libraries.

Predict Angina,Prediction of Angina from healthcare,KagglerSN,2,"Version 1,2018-01-21",,Other,12 KB,Other,95 views,10 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/snehal1409/predict-angina,"Many women who are initially thought to have angina turn out to have normal coronary angiograms, that is they are found not to have angina after all. A study was carried out to assess the feasibility of a preliminary screening test. For a large number of patients who were thought to have angina, information on a number of possible risk factors was collected and then their subsequent angina status was recorded. The data is available as an R data frame entitled angina and contains the following information:
status: whether woman turns out to have angina (yes/no) age: age of a woman smoke: smoking status (1=current-, 2=ex-, 3=non-smoker) cig: current average number of cigarettes per day hyper: hypertension (1=absent, 2=mild, 3=moderate) angfam: family history of angina (yes/no) myofam: family history of myocardial infarction (yes/no) strokefam: family history of stroke (yes/no) diabetes: does woman have diabetes? (yes/no) Missing values are coded as NA.
The main aim of this study was to try to find out which, if any, of the health variables, are associated with angina and whether some subset of them could be used to help predict the dependent variable angina status. The accompanying document on the `Model selection through backward elimination‚Äô is going to be useful for that purpose. More specifically, it would be helpful to be able to estimate the risk/probability that a woman with a particular combination of these health variables truly has angina. If such a scheme of estimating risks can be constructed, is it likely to be useful? i.e. is it good at predicting whether a woman has angina or not (since the treatment of angina is expensive)? In addition, it would be of interest to estimate the individual effects of important variables. For example, if smoking seems to be a risk factor, then what is the odds of a smoker having angina relative to a non-smoker? What about ex-smokers and light smokers?"

I've always had problems with sleep. I felt bad either undersleeping or oversleeping. So last October I promised a friend of mine to get up at 5 AM for one month and started logging sleep data to a Google Spreadsheet. Sometimes I broke my promise, sometimes I was sick or on vacation and overslept but mainly kept my promise. Now with the help of Kaggle community I want to analyze this data and know how much sleep I need. Need to say that I'm fan of Biphasic and polyphasic sleep.
Content
I put a reminder on todo list to enter data everyday. I've decided not to capture many features besides times, only how easy felt asleep, how easy got up and how felt afterwards. There're usually more than one row per day. I usually get up by 5-6 AM and if feel very sleepy go back to sleep again. Sometimes I had a nap in the afternoon or in weekends.
Inspiration
I would like to know minimum amount of sleep I need to feel either ""Very good"" (4.5) or ""Super good"" (5). I guess this will be an average time for the last N days. By the way after how many days body resets it's sleep clock? It would be nice to know optimal time to go to bed too."

This is the City of New York's list of official dog parks.
Some ideas for what could be interesting: mapping the most dog-friendly neighborhoods in the city, perhaps to help dog owners find an apartment in an area with access to bigger or multiple dog runs. If one combined this dataset with others like NYC's dog licensing dataset, one could explore the ratio of the area of dog run space to the number of dogs, perhaps by neighborhood. This could show dogs per square foot of dog park space, painting a picture of which neighborhoods are satisfying the needs of canine citizens and which ones have some work to do.

Please consider citing this article if you want to use the datasets.
Jindong Wang, Yiqiang Chen, Lisha Hu, Xiaohui Peng, and Philip S. Yu. Stratified Transfer Learning for Cross-domain Activity Recognition. 2018 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom).
These datasets are secondly constructed based on three public datasets: OPPORTUNITY (opp) [1], PAMAP2 (pamap2) [2], and UCI DSADS (dsads) [3].
Here are some useful information about this directory. Please feel free to contact jindongwang@outlook.com for more information.
This is NOT the raw data, since I have performed feature extraction and normalized the features into [-1,1]. The code for feature extraction can be found in here: https://github.com/jindongwang/activityrecognition/tree/master/code. Currently, there are 27 features for a single sensor. There are 81 features for a body part. More information can be found in above PerCom-18 paper.
There are 4 .mat files corresponding to each dataset: dsads.mat for UCI DSADS, opp_hl.mat and opp_ll.mat for OPPORTUNITY, and pamap.mat for PAMAP2. Note that opp_hl and opp_loco denotes 'high-level' and 'locomotion' activities, respectively. (1) dsads.mat: 9120 * 408. Columns 1~405 are features, listed in the order of 'Torso', 'Right Arm', 'Left Arm', 'Right Leg', and 'Left Leg'. Each position contains 81 columns of features. Columns 406~408 are labels. Column 406 is the activity sequence indicating the executing of activities (usually not used in experiments). Column 407 is the activity label (1~19). Column 408 denotes the person (1~8). (2) opp_hl.mat and opp_loco.mat: Same as dsads.mat. But they contain more body parts: 'Back', 'Right Upper Arm', 'Right Lower Arm', 'Left Upper Arm', 'Left Lower Arm', 'Right Shoe (Foot)', and 'Left Shoe (Foot)'. Of course we did not use the data of both shoes in our paper. Column 460 is the activity label (please refer to OPPORTUNITY dataset to see the meaning of those activities). Column 461 is the activity drill (also check the dataset information). Column 462 denotes the person (1~4). (3) pamap.mat: 7312 * 245. Columns 1~243 are features, listed in the order of 'Wrist', 'Chest', and 'Ankle'. Column 244 is the activity label. Column 245 denotes the person (1~9).
There are another 3 datasets with the prefix 'cross_', containing only 4 common classes of each dataset. This is for experimenting the cross-dataset activity recognition (see our PerCom-18 paper). The 4 common classes are lying, standing, walking, and sitting. (1) cross_dsads.mat: 1920*406. Columns 1~405 are features. Column 406 is labels. (2) cross_opp.mat: 5022*460. Columns 1~459 are features. Column 460 is labels. (3) cross_pamap.mat: 3063 * 244. Columns 1~243 are features. Column 244 is labels.

Market Segmentation: A company must have different strategies for product promotion for different individuals. Not every individual has the same requirement and demand. So the company has to segment, target and position the product according to the tastes of various individuals.
Segmentation of products based on the revenue generated in different regions is done to understand the market trends.
The segmentation will help the company to devise marketing strategies and promotional schemes to position the right product according to the preference of the consumers in any given segment.
Content
The store dataset contains 10,000 observations or we can call it transactions of 5 variables. Each row represents the transaction made by the reps. Each column contains the attributes of this dataset include: reps - Representative who are involved in the promotion and sale of the products in their respective region. products - There are 12 brands of products promoted by the company. qty - Quantity sold in units revenue - Revenue generated for each transaction region - There are 4 regions - East, North, South and West India.
It would also be possible to predict the revenue and make it a regression task.

Introduction: The dataset used for this experiment is real and authentic. The dataset is acquired from UCI machine learning repository website [13]. The title of the dataset is ‚ÄòCrime and Communities‚Äô. It is prepared using real data from socio-economic data from 1990 US Census, law enforcement data from the 1990 US LEMAS survey, and crimedata from the 1995 FBI UCR [13]. This dataset contains a total number of 147 attributes and 2216 instances.
The per capita crimes variables were calculated using population values included in the 1995 FBI data (which differ from the 1990 Census values).
Content
The variables included in the dataset involve the community, such as the percent of the population considered urban, and the median family income, and involving law enforcement, such as per capita number of police officers, and percent of officers assigned to drug units. The crime attributes (N=18) that could be predicted are the 8 crimes considered 'Index Crimes' by the FBI)(Murders, Rape, Robbery, .... ), per capita (actually per 100,000 population) versions of each, and Per Capita Violent Crimes and Per Capita Nonviolent Crimes)

Your data will be in front of the world's largest data science community. What questions do you want to see answered?
Data available in the dataset may not act as a complete source of information for identifying factors that contribute to more violent and non-violent crimes as many relevant factors may still be missing.
However, I would like to try and answer the following questions answered.
Analyze if number of vacant and occupied houses and the period of time the houses were vacant had contributed to any significant change in violent and non-violent crime rates in communities
How has unemployment changed crime rate(violent and non-violent) in the communities?
Were people from a particular age group more vulnerable to crime?
Does ethnicity play a role in crime rate?
Has education played a role in bringing down the crime rate?"

This dataset has population data of each Indian district from 2001 and 2011 censuses.
The special thing about this data is that it has centroids for each district and state.
Centroids for a district are calculated by mapping border of each district as a polygon of latitude/longitude points in a 2D plane and then calculating their mean center.
Centroids for a state are calculated by calculating the weighted mean center of all districts that constitutes a state. The population count is the weight assigned to each district.
Example Analysis:
The complete code for calculating the centroids and web scraping for the data is shared on GitHub.
The purpose of this project was to map population density center for each state.

The automatic diacritization systems are the best solution to handle this issue. But such automation needs resources as diactritized texts to train and evaluate such systems.
Content
Data is a collection of Arabic vocalized texts, which covers modern and classical Arabic language. The Data contains over 75 million of fully vocalized words obtained from 97 books, structured in text files.
The corpus is collected mostly from Islamic classical books [14], and using semi-automatic web crawling process. The Modern Standard Arabic texts crawled from the Internet represent 1.15% of the corpus, about 867,913 words, while the most part is collected from Shamela Library, which represent 98.85%, with 74,762,008 words contained in 97 books
Acknowledgements
We acknowledge the efforts made by Shamela library volunteers to write, diacritize and make free texts.

SqueezeNet: AlexNet-level accuracy with 50x fewer parameters and <0.5MB model size
Recent research on deep neural networks has focused primarily on improving accuracy. For a given accuracy level, it is typically possible to identify multiple DNN architectures that achieve that accuracy level. With equivalent accuracy, smaller DNN architectures offer at least three advantages: (1) Smaller DNNs require less communication across servers during distributed training. (2) Smaller DNNs require less bandwidth to export a new model from the cloud to an autonomous car. (3) Smaller DNNs are more feasible to deploy on FPGAs and other hardware with limited memory. To provide all of these advantages, we propose a small DNN architecture called SqueezeNet. SqueezeNet achieves AlexNet-level accuracy on ImageNet with 50x fewer parameters. Additionally, with model compression techniques we are able to compress SqueezeNet to less than 0.5MB (510x smaller than AlexNet).

What is a Pre-trained Model?
A pre-trained model has been previously trained on a dataset and contains the weights and biases that represent the features of whichever dataset it was trained on. Learned features are often transferable to different data. For example, a model trained on a large dataset of bird images will contain learned features like edges or horizontal lines that you would be transferable your dataset.
Why use a Pre-trained Model?
Pre-trained models are beneficial to us for many reasons. By using a pre-trained model you are saving time. Someone else has already spent the time and compute resources to learn a lot of features and your model will likely benefit from it."

Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition
In this work we investigate the effect of the convolutional network depth on its accuracy in the large-scale image recognition setting. Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.

Lower back pain can be caused by a variety of problems with any parts of the complex, interconnected network of spinal muscles, nerves, bones, discs or tendons in the lumbar spine. Typical sources of low back pain include:
The large nerve roots in the low back that go to the legs may be irritated The smaller nerves that supply the low back may be irritated The large paired lower back muscles (erector spinae) may be strained The bones, ligaments or joints may be damaged An intervertebral disc may be degenerating An irritation or problem with any of these structures can cause lower back pain and/or pain that radiates or is referred to other parts of the body. Many lower back problems also cause back muscle spasms, which don't sound like much but can cause severe pain and disability.
While lower back pain is extremely common, the symptoms and severity of lower back pain vary greatly. A simple lower back muscle strain might be excruciating enough to necessitate an emergency room visit, while a degenerating disc might cause only mild, intermittent discomfort.
This data set is about to identify a person is abnormal or normal using collected physical spine details/data."
